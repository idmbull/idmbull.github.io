It is very popular in Vietnam, and almost everyone likes it. Pho is made from rice noodles, beef or chicken, and a hot soup cooked with many spices like cinnamon, ginger and onion. People usually eat pho for breakfast, but some also eat it for lunch or dinner. It is sold everywhere, from small street stalls to big restaurants.\nI think pho is important in Vietnamese culture because it shows our simple lifestyle and love for fresh food. When foreigners visit Vietnam, they always try pho first because it represents our country. I often eat pho with my family on weekends, and it makes me feel warm and happy. I believe pho is not only delicious but also a part of our national identity.\nTuần 08 251010\nTopic: Describe a natural disaster you have seen or heard about\n\nOne natural disaster that I remember clearly is the severe flood in Central Vietnam in 2020. Heavy rain lasted for almost a week, causing rivers to overflow and destroying many villages. Thousands of houses were submerged, and people lost their belongings, crops, and even livestock. Many roads were blocked, which made it hard for rescue teams to reach the affected areas.\nI watched the news every day, and the images were heartbreaking. I felt sorry for the people who suffered, especially the children and the elderly. Luckily, many volunteers and soldiers came to provide food, water, and clothes. After the flood, people worked together to rebuild their homes.\nThis disaster reminded me of how important it is to protect nature and to have good plans for disaster prevention. It also showed the strong spirit and kindness of the Vietnamese people.\nTuần 07 251003\n\nI want to talk about Ho Chi Minh City.

When it comes to her appealing appearance, she looks like a supermodel with her slim figure and dazzling smiles. Taylor Swift always dresses to the nines either on stage or at red-carpet events.\nI dare say she has an aptitude for music, and her adoring voice draws people’s attention whenever she performs. You know, her massive hits always dominate the Billboard, one of the most prestigious music charts in the world. Every now and then, she joins her world tours to cosmopolitan metropolitan areas such as New York or London.\nWell, I think there are many vital reasons why Taylor Swift has the world at her feet. First and foremost, her music is absolutely melodious and catchy. Whenever her songs are being sung, I can’t help, yet sing along to them. Secondly, not only is she a well-known singer, but she is also a philanthropist raising fund for handicapped and homeless children who are less fortunate than other children.\n\n\nI dare say: tôi tin rằng\n\n\nhas an aptitude for music: có năng khiếu về âm nhạc\n\n\nmassive hits: những bài hit lớn\n\n\nEvery now and then: thỉnh thoảng\n\n\nmelodious and catchy: du dương và bắt tai\n\n\nShe has a slim figure because she goes to the gym every day.\n\n\nI dare say he’ll arrive late because the traffic is really terrible today.\n\n\nHe always dresses to the nines whenever there’s an important meeting.\n\n\nShe has an aptitude for languages and can learn new ones very quickly.\n\n\nEvery now and then, I like to take a break and go jogging alone.\n\n\nI would like to talk about one of the most renowned bakeries/ coffee houses opened in Sai Gon. When it comes to its location, the shop is situated in the heart of the metropolis, near some must-come tourist attractions such as Notre-dame Cathedral and a well-known skyscraper, Bitexco Financial Tower.\nThe first time that I set foot in the bakery/café was the opening day because they had advertised the shop on the local media a week before opening it. Therefore, locals, including me, knew the exact day. You know, they gave us free box of chocolates, biscuits and breads that were just out of this world.\nThere are naturally a couple of vital reasons why the bakery/coffee shop has risen to fame. First and foremost, the shop’s cakes and desserts make our mouth water and its proximity to the city center allows customers to approach it conveniently. Secondly, the bakery’s/shop’s advertisement on the mass media has drawn people’s attenti on and increased its profile. I highly recommend that everyone visit the shop.\nWhen it comes to cooking, my mom is the best in our family.\nThe hotel is located in the heart of the city, near all the attractions.\nJust thinking about my mom’s spicy noodles makes my mouth water.\nOur office was chosen because of its proximity to the city center.\nThe locals are very friendly and always help tourists find their way around.\nI am going to share with you about a historical event which was also considered as one of the most renowned stories of mythology, The Magical Crossbow. 2500 years ago, in Au Lac realm, King An Duong Vuong was given a magical crossbow which would be used to protect the fledgling kingdom.\nThanks to the crossbow, the country defeated northern invaders. Trieu Da, a northern despot, sought to reconcile and asked his son, Trong Thuy, for getting married with My Chau, a daughter of King An Duong Vuong.\n\nI would like to talk about a long-lasting volume which has belonged to me a couple of decades now. The book originally derived from one of the most renowned stories of mythology called The Magical Crossbow.\nWhen it comes to its absorbing content, its plot revolves around the swap of the magical crossbow, which led to the loss of the realm called Au Lac of King An Duong Vuong. Besides, the love tragedy between Trong Thuy and My Chau really conveys a spectrum of emotions. Speaking of frequency, if I have time\non my hands, I will read it from cover to cover in no time.\nWhen I was just a tiny tot, my parents usually read it as a bedtime story. As I\nget older, when I feel blue, it helped me cope with stress and ease my mind.\nHonestly speaking, I’m not fed up with it, yet I am gradually engrossed in\nreading this ancient book again and again. Moreover, this priceless volume\nhas been an heirloom of my family because it has been passed down through\nmany generations.\n\nI want to talk about an old TV in my house. It’s an old antenna TV that my family bought about fifteen years ago. It’s big and heavy, and it has a long metal antenna on top to receive the signal.\nAt that time, this kind of TV was very popular. The picture was not very clear, and sometimes the signal was bad, so we had to move the antenna around to get a better image. It doesn’t have a flat screen like modern TVs.\nMy parents used to watch news and movies on this TV every evening. When I was a child, I often watched cartoons on it after school. It brings back many happy memories from my childhood.\nWe don’t use it anymore, but it still works. Although it’s old and not modern, I think it’s special because it was part of my family life for many years.\n\nTôi muốn nói về một chiếc tivi cũ trong nhà tôi. Đó là một chiếc tivi dùng ăng-ten mà gia đình tôi mua khoảng mười lăm năm trước. Nó to, nặng, và có một chiếc ăng-ten kim loại dài trên đầu để bắt sóng.\nHồi đó, loại tivi này rất phổ biến. Hình ảnh không được rõ lắm, và đôi khi tín hiệu yếu, nên chúng tôi phải xoay ăng-ten để có hình ảnh tốt hơn. Nó không có màn hình phẳng như tivi hiện đại.\nBố mẹ tôi thường xem tin tức và phim trên chiếc tivi này mỗi tối. Khi tôi còn nhỏ, tôi thường xem phim hoạt hình trên đó sau giờ học. Nó gợi lại nhiều kỷ niệm vui thời thơ ấu của tôi.\nChúng tôi không dùng nó nữa, nhưng nó vẫn hoạt động. Mặc dù nó cũ và không hiện đại, tôi nghĩ nó đặc biệt vì nó đã là một phần trong cuộc sống gia đình tôi suốt nhiều năm.\n\nI want to talk about a time when I got very good service in a small noodle shop near my house. It’s a local and simple place, not fancy at all, but the food and the service were amazing.\nI went there with my friend last month for breakfast. We ordered two bowls of beef pho and some iced tea. The owner, an old lady, was very friendly and kind. She smiled at us and brought the food very quickly.\nThe pho was delicious — hot, tasty, and full of fresh herbs. What I liked most was that the owner was very thoughtful. When I asked for more chili sauce, she gave it right away and even added some lime and onions without me asking.\nI think it was good service because even though the shop was busy, the owner still cared about every customer. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable. I really enjoyed that meal and I often go back there every day.\n\nI’d like to talk about a time when I received really good service at a small noodle shop near my house.

I wanted to find out about cookery classes. I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?\nOFFICIAL:            Well, they’re open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome. OK, let me give you some details of what’s available. There are several classes. One very popular one is at the Food Studio.\nWOMAN:             OK\nOFFICIAL:            They focus on seasonal products, and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to choose them.\nWOMAN:             Right, that sounds good. How big are the classes?\nOFFICIAL:            I’m not sure exactly, but they’ll be quite small.\nWOMAN:             And could I get a private lesson there?\nOFFICIAL:            I think so … let me check, yes, they do offer those. Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it’s a nice way of getting to know one another.\nWOMAN:             I suppose it must be, yes.\nOFFICIAL:            And this company has a special deal for clients where they offer a discount of 20 percent if you return for a further class.\nWOMAN:             OK. But you said there were several classes?\nOFFICIAL:            That’s right. Another one you might be interested in is Bond’s Cookery School. They’re quite new, they just opened six months ago, but I’ve heard good things about them. They concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food, and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.\nWOMAN:             So is that food for people on a diet and things like that? I don’t know if I’d be interested in that.\nOFFICIAL:            Well, I don’t think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss. It’s more to do with recipes that look at specific needs, like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that sort of thing.\nWOMAN:             I see. Well, I might be interested, I’m not sure. Do they have a website I could check?\nOFFICIAL:            Yes, just key in the name of the school – it’ll come up. And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a lecture at the school. It’s free and you don’t need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30. And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.\n—————————\nOFFICIAL:            OK, there’s one more place you might be interested in. That’s got a rather strange name, it’s called The Arretsa Centre – that’s spelled A-R-R-E-T-S-A.\nWOMAN:             OK.\nOFFICIAL:            They’ve got a very good reputation. They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in vegetarian dishes.\nWOMAN:             Right. That’s certainly an area I’d like to learn more about. I’ve got lots of friends who don’t eat meat. In fact, I think I might have seen that school today. Is it just by the market?\nOFFICIAL:            That’s right. So they don’t have any problem getting their ingredients. They’re right next door. And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife. They cover all the different skills – buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques. It gets booked up quickly though so you’d need to check it was available.\n11\nWOMAN:             Right, well thank you very much. I’ll go and …\nSECTION 2\nGood evening everyone. My name’s Phil Sutton, and I’m chairman of the Highways Committee. We’ve called this meeting to inform members of the public about the new regulations for traffic and parking we’re proposing for Granford. I’ll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.\nSo, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we’re very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they’ve been building the new hospital. But it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that’s concerning us (Q11). To date there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we want to see happen, obviously.\nWe recently carried out a survey of local residents, and their responses were interesting. People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads (Q12). We’d expected complaints about the congestion near the school when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by some people.\nWe think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference. But we still have a long way to go. We’ve managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council. But, of course, it’s no good introducing new regulations if we don’t have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them (Q13), and that’s an area we’re still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.\n—————–\n OK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford, with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right. Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road, but we’re planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction (Q14), to regulate the flow or traffic along the High Street.\nWe’re decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing. We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school, but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket (Q15). That’s a very busy area, so it should help things there.\nWe’re proposing some changes to parking. At present, parking isn’t allowed on the High Street outside the library, but we’re going to change that, and allow parking there (Q16), but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.\nThere’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on School Road, just by the entrance to the school (Q17), forbidding parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the bend just to the north of the school.\nAs far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces, so we’ve got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank (Q18). It’s not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.\nWe also plan to widen the pavement on School Road. We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school, on the same side of the road (Q19).\nFinally, we’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am. That’s the supermarket on School Road (Q20) – we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.\nOK. So that’s about it. Now, would anyone …\nSECTION 3\nEMMA:                 We’ve got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven’t we, Jack? Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?\nJACK:                    That’s right. I thought we could look at seed germination – how a seed begins to grow.\nEMMA:                 OK. Any particular reason? I know you’re hoping to work in plant science eventually …\nJACK:                    Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that. No, there’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that (Q21). If I choose that option, I don’t have to do a dissertation module.\nEMMA:                 Good idea.\nJACK:                    Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted. So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.\nEMMA:                 OK. We’d need to allow time for the seeds to come up (Q22).\nJACK:                    That should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer.\nEMMA:                 So that’d make it a good one to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.\nJACK:                    Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we’re going to go ahead with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only ten percent of our final mark, isn’t it? But we need to be sure we’re the only ones doing it (Q23).\nEMMA:                 Yeah, it’s only five percent actually, but it’d be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.\nJACK:                    Did you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?\nEMMA:                 The one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that relevant there. It would be for this experiment, though. I found it quite hard to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected (Q24)\nJACK:                    Yes, I’d been hoping for something more practical. It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.\nEMMA:                 Yes, that was interesting.\nJACK:                    I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.\nEMMA:                 About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?\nJACK:                    That’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research. His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated was done in a lot of detail – very impressive (Q25).\nEMMA:                 Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development? They were very clear.\nJACK:                    I think those diagrams were in another article.\n———————–\nEMMA:                 Anyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment? We’ll need to get going with it quite soon.\nJACK:                    Right. So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds. I think vegetable seeds would be best. And obviously they mustn’t all be the same size. So, how many sorts do we need? About four different ones? (Q26)\nEMMA:                 I think that would be enough. There’ll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.\nJACK:                    Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs (Q27), and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that.\nEMMA:                 That’ll be quite time-consuming. And we also need to decide how deep we’re going to plant the seeds (Q28) – right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.\nJACK:                    OK. So then we get planting. Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot? (Q29)\nEMMA:                 No, I think we need a different one for each seed.\nJACK:                    Right. And we’ll need to label them – we can use different coloured labels. Then we wait for the seeds to germinate – I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like. Then we see if our plants have come up, and write down how tall they’ve grown. (Q30)\nEMMA:                 Then all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there’s any relation between them.\nJACK:                    That’s right. So … \nSECTION 4\nHi. Today we’re going to be looking at animals in urban environments and I’m going to be telling you about some research on how they’re affected by these environments.\nNow, in evolutionary terms, urban environments represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years. And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment. One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the crow, and there’ve been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills (Q31). Another successful species is the pigeon, because they’re able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings, just like they once perched on cliffs by the sea. (Q32).\nBut in fact, we’re now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to city life. And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting is the speed with which they’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast. (Q33)\nLet me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area. So, in the University of Minnesota, a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there. And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years, which is a very short time in evolutionary terms. And she found that during that time, these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals (Q34). Now, we can’t be sure this means they’re more intelligent, but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn’t change, it does suggest that something cognitive was going on. And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life – having to look in different places to find food, for example, and coping with a whole new set of dangers. (Q35)\nThen over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another biologist called Catarina Miranda who’s done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour (Q36). So as you might expect, she’s found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold – they’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts. But there’s one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything new – anything they haven’t experienced before (Q37). And if you think about it, that’s quite sensible for a bird living in the city.\n——————\nJonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments. He’s found that when they’re under stress, their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood (Q38). It’s a sensible-seeming adaptation. A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won’t be very successful.\nThere’s just one more study I’d like to mention which is by Sarah Partan and her team, and they’ve been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment, and they’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails (Q39). You do also see this in the country, but it’s much more prevalent in cities, possibly because it’s effective in a noisy environment.\nSo what are the long-term implications of this? One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent (Q40). Once the animal’s got accustomed to its new environment, it may no longer need the features it’s developed.\nSo, now we’ve had a look…\nTEST 02\nSECTION 1\nJIM:                      Hello, South City Cycling Club.\nWOMAN:             Oh, hi. Er … I want to find out about joining the club.\nJIM:                      Right. I can help you there. I’m the club secretary and my name’s Jim Hunter (Example).\nWOMAN:             Oh, hi Jim.\nJIM:                      So, are you interested in membership for yourself?\nWOMAN:             That’s right.\nJIM:                      OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership. If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the Full membership. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia. (Q1)\nWOMAN:             Right. Well, I’m not really up to that standard. I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.\nJIM:                      Sure. That’s why most people join. So, in that case you’d be better with the Recreational membership. That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19, and 95 dollars if you’re under.\nWOMAN:             I’m 25.\nJIM:                      OK. It’s paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course. Now both types of membership include the club fee of 20 dollars. They also provide insurance in case you have an accident (Q2), though we hope you won’t need that, of course.\nWOMAN:             No. OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think. And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?\nJIM:                      That’s right. And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also permitted to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white.\nWOMAN:             Yes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club?\nJIM:                      No, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online: they’re called Jerriz (Q3). That’s J-E-R-R-I-Z. You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.\nWOMAN:             OK. Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?\nJIM:                      Sure. So we have training rides pretty well every morning, and they’re a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness, but they’re different levels. Level A is pretty fast – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you’d probably be level B (Q4), and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.\nWOMAN:             Right. Well I reckon I’d be level B. So, when are the sessions for that level?\nJIM:                      There are a couple each week. They’re both early morning sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am, and the meeting point’s the stadium (Q5) – do you know where that is?\nWOMAN:             Yes, it’s quite near my home, in fact. OK, and how about the other one?\nJIM:                      That’s on Thursdays. It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park. (Q6)\nWOMAN:             Is that the one just past the shopping mall?\nJIM:                      That’s it.\n————————–\nWOMAN:             So how long are the rides?\nJIM:                      They’re about an hour and a half. So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards (Q7), so it’s quite a social event.\nWOMAN:             OK. That sounds good. I’ve only just moved to the city so I don’t actually know many people yet.\nJIM:                      Well, it’s a great way to meet people.     \nWOMAN:             And does each ride have a leader? (Q8)\nJIM:                      Sometimes, but not always. But you don’t really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.\nWOMAN:             How would we know where to go?\nJIM:                      If you check the club website, you’ll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked. So you can just print that out (Q9) and take it along with you. It’s similar from one week to another, but it’s not always exactly the same.\nWOMAN:             And what do I need to bring?\nJIM:                      Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone. You shouldn’t use if while you’re cycling, buy have it with you.\nWOMAN:             Right.\nJIM:                      And in winter, it’s well before sunrise when we set out, so you need to make sure your bike’s got lights. (Q10)\nWOMAN:             That’s OK. Well, thanks Jim. I’d definitely like to join. So what’s the best way of going about it?\nJIM:                      You can …\nSECTION 2\nThanks for coming everyone. OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven’t been involved with our volunteering projects yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community. We’ve been doing this for the last five years and it’s been very successful.\nParticipating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment. The company will pay for eight hours of your time. That can be used over one or two days all at once, or spread over several months throughout the year (Q11). There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week. It’s completely up to you. Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren’t as available as other members of staff.\nFeedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Because they felt they were doing something really useful, nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work (Q12). They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them. One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.\nOne particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work. Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers, which they had found quite difficult (Q13). This is something many employers look for in job applicants – and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.\nWe’ve got an exciting new project starting this year. Up until now, we’re mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with out reading project in schools and our work with local charities. But we’re also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park (Q14). So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.\nI also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month. The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology. And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College (Q15), as it can hold far more people.\nWe’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part, so we’ll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.\nIf you’re interested in taking part, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form (Q16). We won’t be providing any training for this but you’ll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you’ve never done it before. By the way, don’t forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.\n——————\nThe participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited. The majority were in their seventies, though some where younger and a few were even in their nineties! Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated model (Q17). They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology. A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills (Q18). But that soon changed.\nThe feedback was very positive. The really encouraging thing was that participants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren (Q19), who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails. A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active (Q20). They weren’t that impressed with being able to order their groceries online, as they liked going out to the shops, but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad. One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers – some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them, so that’s something we’ll make sure we include this time … \nSECTION 3\nTUTOR:                Ah … come in, Russ.\nRUSS:                   Thank you.\nTUTOR:                Now you wanted to consult me about your class presentation on nanotechnology – you’re due to give it in next week, aren’t you?\nRUSS:                   That’s right. And I’m really struggling. I chose the topic because I didn’t know much about it and wanted to learn more, but now I’ve read so much about it, in a way there’s too much to say – I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I’ve been allocated. Should I assume the other students don’t know much, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect? (Q21)\nTUTOR:                You could do either, but you’ll need to have it clear in your own mind.\nRUSS:                   Then I think I’ll give an overview.\nTUTOR:                OK. Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.\nRUSS:                   Uh-huh.                             \nTUTOR:                On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.\nRUSS:                   You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent, and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.\nTUTOR:                Exactly. Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area (Q22), say medicine, or space exploration.\nRUSS:                   That would make it easier to focus. Perhaps I should do that.\nTUTOR:                I think that would be a good idea.\nRUSS:                   Right. How important is it to include slides in the presentation?\nTUTOR:                They aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find. While it can be good to includes slides, you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones. You might find it better to leave them out. (Q23)\nRUSS:                   I see. Another thing I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with ‘First I’m going to talk about this, and then I’ll talk about that’, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.\nTUTOR:                That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t do anything with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the short time that’s available.\nRUSS:                   So, maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people’s attention. (Q24)          \nTUTOR:                That sounds sensible.\nRUSS:                   What do you think I should do next? I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.\nTUTOR:                Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation (Q25): it can be something as simple as ‘Nanotechnology is already improving our lives’. Then start planning the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.      \nRUSS:                   OK.\n————————————\nTUTOR:                OK, now let’s think about actually giving the presentation. You’ve only given one before, if I remember correctly, about an experiment you’d been involved in.\nRUSS:                   That’s right. It was pretty rubbish!\nTUTOR:                Let’s say it was better in some respects than in others. With regard to the structure. I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off (Q26). Be careful not to do that in next week’s presentation.\nRUSS:                   OK.\nTUTOR:                And you made very little eye contact with the audience, because you were looking down at your notes most of the time. You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes. (Q27)\nRUSS:                   Mmm.\nTUTOR:                Your body language was a little odd. Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it – you should have been looking at your laptop. And you kept scratching your head, so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that, instead of listening to what you were saying! (Q28)\nRUSS:                   Oh dear. What did you think of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could.\nTUTOR:                Yes, that came across. You used a few words that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t have had any difficulty understanding. (Q29)\nRUSS:                   Uh-huh.\nTUTOR:                I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out. They were a good summary of your presentation, which people would be able to refer to later on (Q30). So well done on that.\nRUSS:                   Thank you.\nTUTOR:                Well, I hope that helps you with next week’s presentation.\nRUSS:                   Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.\nTUTOR:                I’ll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then. \nSECTION 4\nToday, we’ll be continuing the series of lectures on memory by focusing on what is called episodic memory and what can happen if this is not working properly.\nEpisodic memory refers to the memory of an event or ‘episode’. Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past. Episodic memories include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and other information such as the location (Q31). To help understand this concept, try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.\nEpisodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory. This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your general knowledge of the world (Q32). To build upon a previous example, remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory, but your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of sematic memory. Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn’t dependent on recalling personal experiences. (Q33)\nEpisodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing: encoding, consolidation and retrieval.\nThe initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it’s actually happening (Q34). Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult. Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie, you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name. Future recollection of Charlie’s name is much easier if you have a strategy to help you encode it. (Q35)\nMemory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory, is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened, stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval. Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored can be linked to an existing network of information (Q36). Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them (Q37). Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren’t used very often.\nThe last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval, which is the conscious recollection of encoded information. Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors. These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you parked your car you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked (Q38). You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.\n——————\nThere are a wide range of neurological diseases and conditions that can affect episodic memory. These range from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia to autism. An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals’ lives. For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ episodic memory may still be impaired and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent studies have shown that computer- assisted games designed to keep the brain active can help improve their episodic memory. (Q39)\nEpisodic memories can help people connect with others, for instance by sharing intimate details about their past; something individuals with autism often have problems with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self (Q40). This is essential for the storage of episodic memory, and has been found to be impaired in children with autism. Research has shown that treatments that improve memory may also have a positive impact on children’s social development.\nOne study looked at a …\nTEST 03\nSECTION 1\nLINDA:  Hello, Linda speaking.\nMATT:   Oh hi, Linda. This is Matt Brooks. Alex White gave me your number. He said you’d be able to give me some advice about moving to Banford.\nLINDA:  Yes, Alex did mention you. How can I help?\nMATT:   Well, first of all – which area to live in?\nLINDA:  Well, I live in Dalton (Example), which is a really nice suburb – not too expensive, and there’s a nice park.\nMATT:   Sounds good. Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?\nLINDA:  Yeah, you should be able to get something reasonable for 850 (Q1) pounds per month. That’s what people typically pay. You certainly wouldn’t want to pay more than 900 pounds. That doesn’t include bills or anything.\nMATT:   No. That sound alright. I’ll definitely have a look there. Are the transport links easy from where you live?\nLINDA:  Well, I’m very lucky. I work in the city centre so I don’t have to use public transport. I go by bike. (Q2)\nMATT:   Oh, I wish I could do that. Is it safe to cycle around the city?\nLINDA:  Yes, it’s fine. And it keeps me fit. Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare because there’s hardly any parking (Q3). And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.\nMATT:   I’d be working from home but I’d have to go to London one or two days a week.\nLINDA:  Oh, that’s perfect. Getting to London is no problem. There’s a fast train every 30 minutes (Q4) which only takes 45 minutes.\nMATT:   That’s good.\nLINDA:  Yeah, the train service isn’t bad during the week. And they run quite late at night. It’s weekends that are a problem (Q5). They’re always doing engineering work and you have to take a bus to Hadham and pick up the train there, which is really slow. But other than that, Banford’s a great place to live. I’ve never been happier.\n————————          \nLINDA:  There are some nice restaurants in the city centre and a brand new cinema which has only been open a couple of months (Q6). There’s a good arts centre too.\nMATT:   Sounds like Banford’s got it all.\nLINDA:  Yes! We’re really lucky. There are lots of really good aspects to living here. The schools are good and the hospital here is one of the best in the country (Q7). Everyone I know who’s been there’s had a positive experience. Oh, I can give you the name of my dentist too in Bridge Street (Q8), if you’re interested. I’ve been going to him for years and I’ve never had any problems.\nMATT:   Oh, OK. Thanks!\nLINDA:  I’ll find his number and send it to you.\nMATT:   Thanks, that would be really helpful.\nLINDA:  Are you planning to visit Banford soon?\nMATT:   Yes. My wife and I are both coming next week. We want to make some appointments with estate agents.\nLINDA:  I could meet you if you like and show you around.\nMATT:   Are you sure? We’d really appreciate that.\nLINDA:  Either a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, after 5.30. (Q9)\nMATT:   Thursday’s preferable – Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.\nLINDA:  Okay great. Let me know which train your catching and I’ll meet you in the cafe outside. You can’t miss it. It’s opposite the station and next to the museum. (Q10)\nMATT:   Brilliant. I’ll text you next week then. Thanks so much for all the advice.\nLINDA:  No problem. I’ll see you next week.\nSECTION 2\nSo if you are one of those people who hasn’t found the perfect physical activity yet, here are some things to think about which might help you make the right decision for you. The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day. You often have to go very early or late as some gyms can get very crowded but with regular training you’ll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time. (Q11)\nRunning has become incredibly popular in recent years. That’s probably got a lot to do with the fact that it’s a very accessible form of exercise that anyone can run even if you could only run a few meters to begin with (Q12). But make sure you get the right shoes. It’s worth investing in a high quality pair and they don’t come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night. The only thing that may stop you is snow and ice.\nSwimming is another really good way to build fitness. What attracts many people is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year (Q13). On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary. It’s hard to chat to people while you’re swimming lengths.\nCycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years. That’s probably because as well as improving their fitness many people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun (Q14), provided the conditions are right of course. Only fanatics go out in the wind and rain.\nYoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise, which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body. It’s a good way of building strength and with the right instructor there’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports. But don’t expect to find it easy. It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren’t very flexible. Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness program. Obviously there can be significant costs involved. But if you’ve got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals, you’re less likely to give up. Make sure you get someone with a recognised qualification though. Or you could do yourself permanent damage. (Q15&amp;Q16)\n—————–\nWhatever you do, don’t join a gym and you’re sure you’ll make good use of it. So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go. What happens to their good intentions? I don’t think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness or decide they have more important things to do. I think people lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress. That’s when they give up hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also, what people sometimes don’t realize when they start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week, and lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment (Q17&amp;Q18). One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals (Q19), be realistic and don’t push yourself too far. Some people advise writing goals down but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach. Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals (Q20) and don’t get too upset if you experience setbacks. It’s a journey. There are bound to be difficulties along the way.\nSECTION 3\nTUTOR:                OK, Jim. You wanted to see me about your textile design project.\nJIM:                      That’s right. I’ve been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.\nTUTOR:                Why did you choose that topic?\nJIM:                      Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve always been interested in anything to do with colour. Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours. (Q21)\nTUTOR:                They might not all have been natural dyes.\nJIM:                      Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.\nTUTOR:                OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.\nJIM:                      Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton …\nTUTOR:                … and see how different types of dyes affected it?\nJIM:                      Yes. Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon. (Q22)\nTUTOR:                With just one type of dye?\nJIM:                      Various types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.\nTUTOR:                OK.\nJIM:                      So, I did the experiments last week. I used some ready-made natural dyes. I found a website which supplied them, they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.\nTUTOR:                That must have taken quite a bit of time.\nJIM:                      Yes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all. Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to chop up a whole pile of it (Q23). So it all took longer than I’d expected.\nTUTOR:                One possibility is to use food colourings.\nJIM:                      I did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.\nTUTOR:                Tartrazine?\nJIM:                      Yeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour, but when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away (Q24). I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.\nTUTOR:                Were you worried about health issues?\nJIM:                      I’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.\nTUTOR:                Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.\n———————–                          \nTUTOR:                So what natural dyes did you look at?\nJIM:                      Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.\nTUTOR:                It’s meant to be quite good for your health when eaten, but you might find it’s not permanent when it’s used as a dye – a few washes, and it’s gone. (Q25)\nJIM:                      Right. I used beetroot as a dye for wool. When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands, but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade (Q26). Disappointing.\nTUTOR:                There’s a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?\nJIM:                      Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as it was so rare. I didn’t use it. (Q27)\nTUTOR:                It fell out of use centuries ago, though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you use any black dyes?\nJIM:                      Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.\nTUTOR:                I hope you were careful to wear gloves.\nJIM:                      Yes. I know the danger with that dye.\nTUTOR:                Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it’s ingested (Q28). Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?\nJIM:                      Yes. I didn’t actually make that, I didn’t have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website. But it cost a fortune (Q29). I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.\nTUTOR:                Yes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not used as a dye.\nJIM:                      I also read about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.\nTUTOR:                Yes, that works well for dying cotton. But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30) and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …\nSECTION 4\nLast week, we started looking at reptiles, including crocodiles and snakes. Today, I’d like us to have a look at another reptile – the lizard – and in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard whose Latin name is tiliqua rugosa. This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard, because it’s quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dozing under rocks or lying in the sun.\nI’ll start with a general description. Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they’re quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, sleepy lizards are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue (Q31), in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. And they’re much bigger than most European lizards. They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds. (Q32)\nEven though they’re quite large and powerful, with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells, they still have quite a few predators. Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by snakes (Q33). Actually, another threat to their survival isn’t a predator at all, but is man-made – quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they’re trying to cross highways.\nOne study carried out by Michael Freake at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances. And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory, they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky – they didn’t need any other landmarks on the ground. (Q34)\n———————\nObservations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same partner year after year (Q35). And the male and female also stay together for a long time, both before and after the birth of their young.\nIt’s quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this. It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around. But in fact observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs, they have hardly any contact with their parents (Q36). So, there’s not really any evidence to support that idea.\nAnother suggestion’s based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than other males. So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards protection from other males (Q37). But again, we’re not really sure.\nFinally, I’d like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some lizards in the wild and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their tails (Q38). Then we set the lizards free again, and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period. (Q39)\nOne surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected – it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another. So why would that be? Well, again we have no clear evidence, but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious injuries to one another, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this (Q40) – of self-preservation, if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.\nTEST 04\nSECTION 1\nMARTHA:             Hi Alex. It’s Martha Clines here. James White gave me your number. I hope you don’t mind me calling you.\nBuy bestselling books online\nALEX:                    Of course not. How are you, Martha?\nMARTHA:             Good thanks. I’m ringing because I need a bit of advice.\nALEX:                    Oh yeah. What about?\nMARTHA:             The training you did at JPNW a few years ago. I’m applying for the same thing.\nALEX:                    Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014 (Example). Best thing I ever did. I’m still working there.\nMARTHA:             Really? What are you doing?\nALEX:                    Well, now I work in the customer services department but I did my initial training in Finance (Q1). I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.\nMARTHA:             That’s the same department I’m applying for. Did you enjoy it?\nALEX:                    I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed Maths (Q2). But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.\nMARTHA:             Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period? I’m hoping to do the one in business skills.\nALEX:                    Yes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead. (Q3)\nMARTHA:             OK, that’s good to know. What about the other trainees? How did you get on with them?\nALEX:                    There were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age – I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me, how was 17 (Q4). The rest were between 18 and 20. I made some good friends.\nMARTHA:             I’ve heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW. It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.\nALEX:                    Yeah, definitely. Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.\nMARTHA:             What about pay? I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.\nALEX:                    That’s right – which isn’t great. Buy you get the same number of days’ holiday as everyone else (Q5). And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.\nMARTHA:             Yeah, but I’m not doing it for the money – it’s the experience I think will be really useful. Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.\nALEX:                    You’re right. That’s the most useful part about it. There’s a lot of variety too. You’re given lots of different things to do. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.\nMARTHA:             Do you have to spend any time in college?\nALEX:                    Yes, one day each month (Q6). So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.\nMARTHA:             That’s good. And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it?\nALEX:                    Yes, it’s very close to the train station so the location’s a real advantage. (Q7)\n———————-             \nALEX:                    Have you got a date for your interview yet?\nMARTHA:             Yes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.\nALEX:                    So long as you’re well prepared there’s nothing to worry about. Everyone’s very friendly.\nMARTHA:             I am not sure what I should wear. What do you think?\nALEX:                    Nothing too casual – like jeans (Q8), for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.\nMARTHA:             OK. Thanks. Any other tips?\nALEX:                    Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time (Q9). They hate people who are late. So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to. And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to smile (Q10). Even if you feel terrified. It makes people respond better to you.\nMARTHA:             I’ll have to practise doing that in the mirror!\nALEX:                    Yeah – well, good luck. Let me know if you need any more information.\nMARTHA:             Thanks very much.\nSECTION 2\nHi everyone, welcome to the Snow Centre. My name’s Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport – we’ve certainly got plenty of snow today! Well, you’ve come to New Zealand’s premier snow and ski centre, and we’ve a whole load of activities for you during your week here.\nMost visitors come here for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for most of the time, rather than going down steep mountainsides. There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed (Q11). You can go at your own speed – it’s great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.\nThis afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter sled festival. If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them (Q12), following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger.\nAt the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all welcome to join in. We have a local school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are taking part too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and there’s a medal for everyone who takes part (Q13). Participants are in teams of two to four, and each team must complete four laps of the course.\nFor your final expedition, you’ll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an area where miners once searched for gold, though there are very few traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants. It’s a long ascent, though not too steep, and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit (Q14) and return.\nYou’ll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay. It’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking (Q15). For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you need to take your own food.\nThe weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy. In that case, stay in the hut – generally the storms don’t last long (Q16). Don’t stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut but only use that if it’s real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured.\n—————–\nNow, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here.\nHighland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now. This trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their technique (Q17).\nThen there’s Pine Trail … if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below – scary! But if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun (Q18).\nStony Trail’s a good choice once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging. There’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine. (Q19)\nAnd finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a gentle river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the trail’s open that day. (Q20)\nRight, so now if you’d like to follow me, we’ll get started …\nSECTION 3\nJACK:     I’ve still got loads to do for our report on nutritional food labels.\nALICE:   Me too. What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?\nJACK:     Well, I’ve always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that I’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is. (Q21)\nALICE:   This project has actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully. I tended to believe claims on packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realise that the ‘healthy’ yoghurt I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that it’s actually quite high in calories. (Q22)\nJACK:     Ready meals are the worst … comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. Did you have any idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed.\nALICE:   Yes, because unless you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza. (Q23)\nJACK:     When most people eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it?\nALICE:   Not at all. But I expect it won’t stop you from buying pizza?\nJACK:     Probably not, no! I thought comparing the different labelling systems used by food manufactures was interesting. I think the kind of labelling system used makes a big difference.\nALICE:   Which one did you prefer?\nJACK:     I liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains. I’m not sure it’s the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story (Q24). I like to know all the ingredients in a product – not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain.\nALICE:   But it’s good supermarkets have been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.\nJACK:     Yes. There just needs to be more consistency between labelling systems used by different supermarkets, in terms of portion sizes, etc.\nALICE:   Mmm. The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren’t they?\nJACK:     Yeah. I don’t understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour when they only contain artificial additives. (Q25)\nALICE:   I know. I’d at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken.\nJACK:     Absolutely.\nALICE:   I think having nutritional food labeling has been a good idea, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.\nJACK:     But didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily stop buying unhealthy products.\nALICE:   They only said that might be the case.  Those findings weren’t that conclusive (Q26) and it was quite a small-scale study. I think more research has to be done.\nJACK:     Yes, I think you’re probably right.\n——————–\nJACK:     What do you think of the traffic-light system?\nALICE:   I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.\nJACK:     Buy it’s not been adopted universally (Q27&amp;28). And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?\nALICE:   Pressure from the food manufacturers. Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.\nJACK:     I’d have thought it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn’t.\nALICE:   I know. And what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation – a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.\nJACK:     That is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.\nALICE:   Yeah, maybe.\nJACK:     The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.\nALICE:   Mmm. But I don’t think they targeted the right people. They should have focused on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.\nJACK:     Yeah. But it’s good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups (Q29&amp;30). And there wasn’t much variation in their responses.\nALICE:   No. But if they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could have used a much bigger sample size. I wonder why they chose that method?\nJACK:     Dunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached?\nALICE:   I think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.\nSECTION 4\nIn my presentation, I’m going to talk about coffee, and its importance both in economic and social terms. We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there’s hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, although of course that doesn’t mean that people didn’t know about it before then.\nHowever, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa. In the early sixteenth century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East. It’s also known that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court physician approved its use as a medicine.\nBy the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen and for the next hundred years this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world. What’s particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day. But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was potentially dangerous, and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the coffee houses in the city (Q31), although after his death many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued. In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to universities (Q32). The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life, and many social movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions. (Q33)\n——————–\nIn the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonization. Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. Different types of coffee were produced in different areas, and it’s interesting that the names given to these different types, like Mocha or Java coffee, were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from (Q34). But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences.\nIn Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, coffee was grown in huge plantations and the workers there were almost all slaves (Q35). But this wasn’t the same in all colonies; for example in Java, which had been colonized by the Dutch, the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used as a means of taxation (Q36). But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the eighteenth century, coffee production was very closely linked to colonisation. Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it became nearly as important as sugar production (Q37), which was grown under very similar conditions. However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses and it still remained something of a luxury item. In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was tea, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1766, they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA (Q38), as it still is today.\nSo, by the early nineteenth century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall. This was partly because new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient (Q39). So now, working people could afford to buy coffee – it wasn’t just a drink for the middle classes. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark; they might have to continue throughout the night (Q40). So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important – it wasn’t just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast.\nThere were also changes in cultivation …"},"IELTS/Audioscripts-Cam-14-Listening":{"slug":"IELTS/Audioscripts-Cam-14-Listening","filePath":"IELTS/Audioscripts Cam 14 Listening.md","title":"Audioscripts Cam 14 Listening","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"1.Hiện tại đơn 2.Quá khứ đơn 3.Tương lai đơn 4.Hiện tại tiếp diễn 5.Quá khứ tiếp diễn 6.Tương lai tiếp diễn 7.Hiện tại hoàn thành 8.Quá khứ hoàn thành 9.Tương lai hoàn thành 10.Hiện tại hoàn thành tiếp diễn 11.Quá khứ hoàn thành tiếp diễn 12.Tương lai hoàn thành tiếp diễn 13.Modal verb\nTEST 1\nSECTION 1\nOFFICER:         Good morning. What can I do for you?\nLOUISE:           I want to report a theft. I had some things stolen out of my bag yesterday.\nOFFICER:         I’m sorry to hear that. Right, so I’ll need to take a few details. Can I start with your name?\nLOUISE:           Louise Taylor. \nOFFICER:         OK, thank you. And are you resident in the UK?\nLOUISE:           No, I’m actually Canadian. Though my mother was British.\nOFFICER:         And your date of birth?\nLOUISE:           December 14th, 1977.\nOFFICER:         So you’re just visiting this country?\nLOUISE:           That’s right. I come over most summers^[hầu hết mùa hè] on business. I’m an interior designer^[nhà thiết kế nội thất] and I come over to buy old furniture, antiques you know. There are some really lovely things around here, but you need to get out to the small towns. I’ve had a really good trip this year, until this happened.\nOFFICER:         OK. So you’ve been here quite a while?^[I’ve been here for a long time._ ≈ _I’ve been here quite a while.]\nLOUISE:           Yes, I’m here for two months. I go back next week.\nOFFICER:         So may I ask where you’re staying now?      \nLOUISE:           Well at present I’ve got a place at Park Apartments, that’s on King Street. I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was only available for six weeks so I had to find another one.\nOFFICER:         OK. And the apartment number?\nLOUISE:           Fifteen.\nLOUISE:           Right.\n…………………………………………..\nOFFICER:         Now, I need to take some details of the theft. So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?\nLOUISE:           That’s right.\nOFFICER:         And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?\nLOUISE:           Yes, I really can’t understand it. I had my backpack on. And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things and when I opened it up my wallet wasn’t there.\nOFFICER:         And what did your wallet have in it?\nLOUISE:           Well, fortunately I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet – I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there was quite a bit of cash there … about £250 sterling, I should think. I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday, but I did a bit of shopping, so I must have already spent about £50 of that.\nOFFICER:         OK.\nLOUISE:           At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment, but then I realised my phone had gone as well. It was only a week old, and that’s when I realised I’d been robbed^[I had been robbed → thì quá khứ hoàn thành bị động]. Anyway at least they didn’t take the keys to my rental car.\nOFFICER:         Yes. So you say the theft occurred yesterday?\nLOUISE:           Yes.\nOFFICER:         So that was September the tenth. And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?\nLOUISE:           Well at first I couldn’t believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch. It’s just a small backpack, but I generally use it when I’m travelling because it seems safer than a handbag. Anyway, I met up with a friend, and we spent a couple of hours^[a couple of hours: Cụm danh từ, tân ngữ, chỉ khoảng thời gian.] in the museum. But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding round us, and they were asking us that time it was, then all of a sudden^[all of a sudden: Thành ngữ (idiom), mang nghĩa “bất thình lình.”] they ran off.\nOFFICER:         Can you remember anything about them?\nLOUISE:           The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something … let’s see … a tiger.\nOFFICER:         Right. Any idea of how old he might have been?\nLOUISE:           Around twelve years old?\nOFFICER:         And can you remember anything else about his appearance?\nLOUISE:           Not much. He was quite thin …\nOFFICER:         Colour of hair?\nLOUISE:           I do remember that – he was blond. All the others were dark-haired.\nOFFICER:         And any details of the others?\nLOUISE:           Not really. They came and went so quickly.\nOFFICER:         Right. So what I’m going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company. So this is ten digits: \nLOUISE:           Thank you. So should I …\nSECTION 2\nGood morning everyone^[Chào buổi sáng mọi người]. My name’s Janet Parker and I’m the human resources manager^[Tên tôi là Janet Parker và tôi là trưởng phòng nhân sự]. We’re very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship^[Chúng tôi rất vui mừng được chào đón bạn đến với kỳ thực tập mới của mình]. I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you^[Tôi hy vọng rằng sáu tháng tới sẽ là một trải nghiệm tích cực và thú vị cho bạn].\nI’d like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice^[Tôi muốn bắt đầu bằng một vài lời khuyên chung về việc làm một người học việc]. Most of you^[Hầu hết các bạn] have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation^[ có rất ít hoặc thậm chí chưa có kinh nghiệm làm việc cho một tổ chức lớn] and the first week or so may be quite challenging^[và khoảng tuần đầu tiên có thể sẽ khá là đầy thử thách]. There will be a lot of new information to take in^[Sẽ có rất nhiều thông tin mới cần phải tiếp thu] but don’t worry too much about trying to remember everything^[nhưng đừng quá lo lắng về việc phải cố gắng nhớ hết tất cả mọi thứ]. The important thing^[Điều quan trọng nhất] is to check with someone^[là phải hỏi ý kiến ai đó] if you’re not sure^[nếu bạn không chắc chắn] what to do^[phải làm gì] – you’ll find your supervisor is very approachable^[người hướng dẫn của bạn rất dễ gần] and won’t mind explaining things or helping you out^[và không ngại giải thích mọi thứ hoặc giúp đỡ bạn]. You’re here to learn^[Bạn ở đây là để học hỏi] so make the most of^[tận dụng tối đa] that opportunity^[vì vậy hãy tận dụng tối đa cơ hội đó đi]. You’ll be spending time^[Bạn sẽ dành thời gian] in different departments^[ở các phòng ban khác nhau] during your first week^[trong tuần đầu tiên của bạn] so make an effort^[vì vậy hãy cố gắng] to talk to as many people as possible^[“as many… as possible”: cấu trúc so sánh ngang bằng, có nghĩa là “càng nhiều… càng tốt”.] about their work^[ thế nên nhớ chủ động bắt chuyện với thật nhiều đồng nghiệp để tìm hiểu về công việc của họ] – you’ll make some new friends^[Bạn không những có thêm bạn mới] and find out lots of useful information^[mà còn học hỏi được vô số điều bổ ích].\nAs well as having a supervisor^[Ngoài việc có người giám sát], you’ll each be assigned a mentor^[mỗi người còn được phân công một người hướng dẫn nữa]. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship^[Người này sẽ là một người vừa mới hoàn thành chương trình học việc] and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis^[và bạn sẽ gặp người cố vấn này hàng tuần]. Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship^[Vai trò của người cố vấn là cung cấp sự giúp đỡ và hỗ trợ xuyên suốt quá trình học việc của bạn]. Of course^[dĩ nhiên], this doesn’t mean they’ll actually do any of your work for you^[họ sẽ thực sự làm thay bất kỳ công việc nào của bạn] – instead^[thay vào đó] they’ll be asking you^[họ sẽ hỏi bạn] about what goals you’ve achieved so far^[về những mục tiêu nào bạn đã đạt được cho đến nay], as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement^[đồng thời hỗ trợ bạn nhận ra các mặt cần trau dồi thêm].

So please don’t assume you’ll automatically be permitted to do this^[Vì vậy, làm ơn đừng mặc định cho rằng bạn sẽ tự động được cho phép làm điều này].\nI want to make sure^[tôi muốn đảm bảo chắc chắn] there’s no confusion about our holiday policy^[không có sự nhầm lần nào về chính sách nghỉ phép của chúng tôi]. Apart from^[Apart from: ngoài trừ] any statutory public holidays^[any statutory public holidays: các ngày nghỉ lễ theo quy định] we ask that^[chúng tôi yêu cầu rằng] you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished. Time off^[thời gian nghỉ phép] should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.\nYou’ll be expected^[yêu cầu, mong đợi] to work a 40-hour week but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this, it can be a valuable experience^[kinh nghiệm quý giá] – so we advise you to take it up if possible. Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work, so don’t worry if there are times^[there are times = có những lúc] when you are unavailable.\nAs you know, we don’t have a formal dress code here – you may wear casual clothes as long as^[as long as = miễn là] they’re practical – and the only restriction^[the only restriction … is on … = sự hạn chế duy nhất … là …] for shoes we have is on high heels^[high heels = giày cao gót] for health and safety reasons. Comfortable shoes like trainers^[trainers = giày thể thao] are preferable.\nThere’s a heavily subsidised canteen^[a heavily subsidised canteen = một căn tin được trợ giá nhiều] on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks are also provided – so we’ve decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy. This is partly to encourage^[partly to encourage: một phần để khuyến khích] healthy eating at work and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.\nOK moving on to …\nSECTION 3\nTUTOR:            OK, so what I’d like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning. You should have done most of the reading now, so I’d like you to share your ideas, and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.\nBuy bestselling books online\nCARLA:            OK Rob. I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – cities built next to the sea. It made it much easier to find relevant information.\nROB:                Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s population lives in cities now.\nCARLA:            Yeah, though that’s all cities, not just ones on the coast. But (Q21) most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea. I’d not realised that before.\nROB:                Nor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.\nCARLA:            Why?\nROB:                Well, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except (Q22) it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers.\nCARLA:            So these are brought downstream to the cities?\nROB:                Right. Hmm. Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?\nCARLA:            No.\nROB:                Well, apparently back in the 1950s they build channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.\nCARLA:            Sounds sensible.\nROB:                Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them. (Q23) But what they didn’t take into account was global warming. So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level, and now sea levels are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The whole design was faulty.\nCARLA:            So what are the authorities doing about it now?\nROB:                I don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste into the ocean over the next ten years.\nCARLA:            But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?\nROB:                No. Really (Q24) they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels, in order to protect against flooding now. But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.\nCARLA:            Right. Really, though, coastal cities can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.\nROB:                Absolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them, so (Q25) they should be able to work together to some extent. But it’s going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by.\nCARLA:            Yes, if they ever do.\n——————————\nCARLA:            So I think we’ve probably got enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.\nROB:                OK. So I suppose we’ll begin with some general historical background about why coastal cities were established. But (Q26) we don’t want to spend too long on that, the other students will already know a bit about it. It’s all to do with communications and so on.\nCARLA:            Yes. We should mention some geographical factors, things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on. We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.\nROB:                On a handout you mean? Or (Q27) some slides everyone can see?\nCARLA:            Yeah, that’d be better.\nROB:                It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?\nCARLA:            Yes, (Q28) We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk. I don’t think the other students will have read it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.\nROB:                OK. So that’s probably enough background.\nCARLA:            So then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.\nROB:                OK. What else do we need to talk about? Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.\nCARLA:            Yeah. We’ll need to do a bit of work there, I haven’t got much information, have you?\nROB:                No. (Q29) We’ll need to look at some websites. Shouldn’t take too long.\nCARLA:            OK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe (Q30) we could ask people in the audience. We’ve got people from quite a lot of different places.\nROB:                That’d be interesting, if we have time, yes. So now shall we …\nSECTION 4\nProducing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem. Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding (Q31) industry. Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a number of years now, scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline marine renewable energy – also called ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.\nMarine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories: wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion, and I’ll say a few words about each one.\nFirst, wave energy. Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method. This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is (Q32) constant, and there’s no danger of waves coming to s standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir, or offshore systems. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every (Q33) direction. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line. Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean (Q34) floor might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.\n——————————–\nThe second category of marine energy that I’ll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy is that it’s (Q35) predictable: we know the exact time of high and low tides for years to come.\nFor tidal energy to be effective, the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth. But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon, an area of sea water separated from the sea.\nOne current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a (Q36) bay at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity. Then, for three hours as the tide goes out, the water is held back within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea. Then, in order to release the stored water, (Q37) gates in the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.\nThis system has quite a lot in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the turbines are operated without the need for (Q38) fuel, so it doesn’t create any greenhouse gas emissions; and very little maintenance is needed. It’s estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create than 2,000 (Q39) jobs, a big boost to the local economy.\nOn the other hand, there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing (Q40) migration patterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.\nThere are other forms of tidal energy, but I’ll go on to the third category of marine energy: ocean thermal energy conversion. This depends on there being a big difference in temperature between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe. The concept dates back to 1881, when …\nTEST 2\nSECTION 1\nCARL:               Hi, come and take a seat.\nJULIE:               Thank you.\nCARL:               My name’s Carl Rogers and I’m one of the doctors^[one of the + plural noun: một trong những …] here at the Total Health Clinic. So I understand this is your first visit to the clinic?\nJULIE:               Yes, it is.\nCARL:               OK, well I hope you’ll be very happy with the service you receive here. So if it’s alright with you I’ll take a few details to help me give you the best possible service.\nJULIE:               Sure.\nCARL:               So can I check first of all that we have the correct personal details for you? So your full name is Julie Anne Garcia?\nJULIE:               That’s correct.\nCARL:               Perfect. And can I have a contact phone number?\nJULIE:               It’s 219 442 9785.\nCARL:               OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth?\nJULIE:               October tenth, 1992.\nCARL:               Oh, I actually have 1991, I’ll just correct that now. Right, so that’s all good. Now I just need just a few more personal details … do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time?\nJULIE:               Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy’s – you know, the restaurant chain. I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I’m a manager now.\nCARL:               Oh I know them, yeah, they’re down on 114th Street, aren’t they?\nJULIE:               That’s right.\nCARL:               Yeah, I’ve been there a few times. I just love their salads.\nJULIE:               That’s good to hear.\nCARL:               Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you’re here, Julie, and that’s the name of your insurance company.\nJULIE:               It’s Cawley Life Insurance, that’s C-A-W-L-E-Y.\nCARL:               Excellent, thank you so much.\n——————————-\nJULIE:               Now Julie, let’s^[let’s = let us, cấu trúc rủ rê/gợi ý: “hãy …”.] look at how we can help you. So tell me a little about what brought you here today.\nCARL:               Well, I’ve been getting a pain in my knee, the left one. Not very serious at first, but it’s gotten worse, so I thought I ought to see someone about it.\nJULIE:               That’s certainly the right decision. So how long have you been aware of this pain? Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?\nCARL:               Longer. It’s been worse for the last couple of days, but it’s three weeks since I first noticed it. It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.\nJULIE:               And have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in anyway?\nCARL:               Yeah, I’ve been taking medication to deal with the pain. Tylenol, and that works OK for a few hours. But I don’t like to keep taking it.\nJULIE:               OK. And what about heat treatment? Have you tried applying heat at all?\nCARL:               No, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.\nJULIE:               And does that seem to help the pain at all?\nCARL:               A little, yes.\nJULIE:               Good. Now you look as if you’re quite fit normally?\nCARL:               I am, yes.\nJULIE:               So do you do any sport on a regular basis?\nCARL:               Yes, I play a lot of tennis. I belong to a club so I go there a lot. I’m quite competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the exercise. But I haven’t gone since this started.\nJULIE:               Sure. And do you do any other types of exercise?\nCARL:               Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming, but usually just when I’m on vacation. But normally I go running a few times a week, maybe three or four times.\nJULIE:               Hmm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding. But you haven’t had any problems up to now?\nCARL:               No, not with my legs. I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my shoulder, but that’s better now.\nJULIE:               Excellent. And do you have any allergies?\nCARL:               No, none that I’m aware of.\nJULIE:               And do you take any medication on a regular basis?\nCARL:               Well, I take vitamins but that’s all. I’m generally very healthy.\nJULIE:               OK, well let’s have a closer look and see what might be causing this problem. If you can just get up …\nSECTION 2\nWe’ll be arriving at Branley Castle in about five minutes^[Chúng ta sẽ đến lâu đài Branley trong khoảng 5 phút nữa], but before we get there I’ll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include^[nhưng trước khi đến đó, tôi sẽ cung cấp cho bạn một ít thông tin về lâu đài và những gì chuyến thăm của ta sẽ bao gồm].\nSo in fact there’s been a castle on this site for over eleven hundred years^[Thực tế đã có một lâu đài tại đây hơn mười một thế kỷ]. The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD^[Công trình đầu tiên là một pháo đài được xây dựng vào năm 914 sau công nguyên] for defence against Danish invaders^[để phòng thủ chống lại quân xâm lược Đan Mạnh] by King Alfred the Great’s daughter^[do con gái Vua Alfred Đại Đế cho xây], who ruled England at the time^[người mà lúc đó đang cai trị nước Anh]. In the following century^[trong thế kỷ tiếp theo], after the Normans conquered England^[sau khi người Normans chinh phục nước Anh], the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere^[mảnh đất được trao cho một quý tộc tên là Richard de Vere], and he built a castle there^[và ông ta đã xây một lâu đài ở đó] that stayed in the de Vere family for over four hundred years^[lâu đài ấy thuộc về gia tộc de Vere trong hơn 400 năm].\nHowever^[tuy nhiên], when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576^[khi Nữ hoàng Elizabeth I thông báo rằng bà sẽ đến thăm lâu đài vào năm 1576] it was beginning to look a bit run down^[lâu đài bắt đầu có vẻ hơi xuống cấp], and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms^[và người ta quyết định rằng thay vì sửa chữa các phòng dành cho khách], they’d make a new house for her out of wood^[out of + material = “làm từ … / bằng …”] next to the main hall^[họ sẽ xây một ngôi nhà mới bằng gỗ bên cạnh đại sảnh. ]. She stayed there for four nights^[Bà ấy đã ở đó bốn đêm] and apparently it was very luxurious^[và rõ ràng là nó rất sang trọng], but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire^[nhưng tiếc là nó đã bị hỏa hoạn thiêu rụi vài năm sau đó.].\nIn the seventeenth century^[Vào thế kỷ XVII] the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family^[lâu đài thuộc về gia đình Fenys giàu có], who enlarged it and made it more comfortable^[họ đã mở rộng nó và làm cho nó thoải mái hơn.]. However^[tuy nhiên], by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle^[đến năm 1982, gia đình Fenys không còn khả năng duy trì lâu đài], even though they received government support^[mặc dù họ đã nhận được sự hỗ trợ của chính phủ], and they put it on the market^[và họ đã rao bán nó trên thị trường]. It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks^[Cuối cùng nó đã được tiếp quản bởi một công ty sở hữu một số công viên giải trí], but when we get there^[nhưng khi chúng ta đến đó] I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle^[ tôi nghĩ bạn sẽ thấy rằng họ đã cố gắng giữ lại bầu không khí ban đầu của lâu đài.].\nWhen you go inside^[Khi bạn đi vào bên trong], you’ll find that in the state rooms^[bạn sẽ thấy trong các phòng khánh tiết] there are life-like moving wax models^[những mô hình tượng sáp chuyển động giống như thật] dressed in costumes of different periods in the past^[được mặc trong những trang phục của các thời kỳ khác nhau trong quá khứ.], which even carry on conversations together^[thậm chí còn trò chuyện với nhau nhau]. As well as that^[ngoài ra], in every room there are booklets^[trong mỗi phòng đều có những cuốn sách nhỏ] giving information about^[cung cấp thông tin về] what the room was used for^[mục đích sử dụng của căn phòng] and the history of the objects and furniture it contains^[cũng như lịch sử của các đồ vật và đồ đạc trong phòng].\nThe castle park’s quite extensive^[Công viên lâu đài khá rộng]. At one time sheep were kept there^[Ngày xưa cừu từng được nuôi ở đó ], and in the nineteenth century^[vào thế kỷ 19] the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant^[những người chủ có một đã có một vườn thú nhỏ với những con vật như thỏ và thậm chỉ cả một con voi con]. Nowadays^[ngày này] the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of painting and sculpture^[những tòa nhà vườn thú cũ được sử dụng cho các cuộc trưng bày công cộng về hội họa và điêu khắc]. The park also has some beautiful trees^[Công viên cũng có nhiều cây đẹp], though the oldest of all^[mặc dù cây cổ nhất trong số đó], which dated back 800 years^[có niên đại 800 năm], was sadly blown down in 1987.\nNow^[hiện nay], you’re free to wander around on your own^[“on your own” là một cụm từ cố định mang nghĩa “một mình” hoặc “tự mình”] until 4.30^[bạn có thể tự do đi tham quan cho đến 4 giờ 30], but then at the end of our visit^[nhưng sau đó vào cuối chuyến thăm của chúng ta] we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase^[tất cả chúng ta sẽ gặp nhau ở cuối Cầu thang Lớn]. We’ll then go on to the long gallery^[Sau đó, chúng ta sẽ đi đến phòng trưng bày đã từ rất lâu rồi], where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs^[nơi có một bộ sưu tập ảnh tuyệt đẹp] showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory^[chụp gia đình từng sở hữu lâu đài 100 năm trước, khi họ uống trà và ăn bánh trong nhà kính.] – and we’ll then take you to the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you^[và sau đó chúng tôi sẽ đưa bạn đến chính địa điểm đó, nơi trà chiều sẽ được phục vụ cho bạn].\n——————————-\nNow if you can take a look at your plans^[Bây giờ, nếu bạn có thể xem qua kế hoạch của mình] you’ll see Branley Castle has four towers, joined together by a high wall, with the river on two sides^[bạn sẽ thấy Lâu đài Branley có bốn tòa tháp, được nối với nhau bằng một bức tường cao, với dòng sông ở hai bên].\nDon’t miss seeing the Great Hall^[Đừng bỏ lỡ việc chiêm ngưỡng Đại Sảnh Lớn]. That’s near the river in the main tower^[Nó nằm gần sông trong tòa tháp chính], the biggest one^[tòa tháp lớn nhất], which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century^[được mở rộng và thiết kế lại vào thế kỷ thứ mười tám].\nIf you want to get a good view of the whole castle^[Nếu bạn muốn có một tầm nhìn đẹp bao quát toàn bộ lâu đài], you can walk around the walls^[bạn có thể đi bộ xung quanh những bức tường]. The starting point’s quite near the main entrance^[Điểm bắt đầu khá gần lối vào chính] – walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it’s just there^[hãy đi thẳng xuống con đường cho đến khi bạn đến cổng phía nam, và nó ở ngay đó]. Don’t go on to the north gate^[Đừng đi tiếp đến cổng bắc] – there’s no way up from there^[từ đó thì không có lối nào đi lên].\nThere’ll shortly be a show^[Sắp tới sẽ có một buổi biểu diễn] in which you can see archers displaying their skill^[mà trong đó bạn có thể xem những người bắn cung thể hiện kỹ năng của họ] with a bow and arrow^[với cung và tên]. The quickest way to get there^[Cách nhanh nhất để đến đó] is to take the first left after the main entrance^[là rẽ trái đầu tiên sau lối vào chính] and follow the path past the bridge^[và đi theo con đường băng qua cây cầu], then you’ll see it in front of you at the end^[rồi bạn sẽ thấy nó ngay trước mặt mình ở cuối đường.].\nIf you like animals^[Nếu bạn thích động vật] there’s also a display of hunting birds^[thì cũng có một buổi trưng bày các loài chim săn mồi] – falcons and eagles and so on^[như chim ưng, đại bàng và vân vân]. If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate^[Nếu bạn đi từ cổng chính theo hướng cổng phía nam], but turn right before you get there^[nhưng rẽ phải trước khi đến đó] instead of going through it^[thay vì đi xuyên qua cổng], you’ll see it on your right past the first tower^[bạn sẽ thấy nó ở bên phải khi đi qua tòa tháp đầu tiên].\nAt 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage^[Vào lúc 3 giờ chiều, có một màn biểu diễn múa truyền thống ngắn trên sân khấu ngoài trời]. That’s right at the other side of the castle^[Nó nằm ngay phía bên kia lâu đài] from the entrance^[tính từ cổng vào], and over the bridge^[và qua cây cầu]. It’s about ten minutes’ walk or so^[Sẽ mất khoảng mười phút đi bộ hoặc lâu hơn].\nAnd finally the shop^[Và cuối cùng là cửa hàng]. It’s actually inside one of the towers^[Thật ra nó nằm bên trong một trong các tòa tháp], but the way in is from the outside^[nhưng lối vào là từ bên ngoài]. Just take the first left after the main entrance^[Chỉ cần rẽ trái đầu tiên sau lối vào chính], go down the path and take the first right^[đi xuống con đường và rẽ phải ở chỗ rẽ đầu tiên]. It’s got some lovely gifts and souvenirs^[Trong đó có một vài món quà và đồ lưu niệm đẹp].\nRight, so we’re just arriving …\nSECTION 3\nTUTOR:            So, Rosie and Martin, let’s look at what you’ve got for your presentation on woolly mammoths.\nROSIE:             OK, we’ve got a short outline here.\nTUTOR:            Thanks. So it’s about a research project in North America?\nMARTIN:         Yes. But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.\nROSIE:             Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, (Q21) it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?\nMARTIN:         Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.\nTUTOR:            Good. Then you’re describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.\nROSIE:             Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in really good condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.\nTUTOR:            So why was that significant?\nROSIE:             Well (Q22) the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that. So this was really amazing.\nMARTIN:         Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.\nROSIE:             Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland. So (Q23) those mammoths on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island.\nMARTIN:         And in fact the species survived there for thousands of years after they’d become extinct on the mainland.\nTUTOR:            So why do you think they died out on the mainland?\nROSIE:             No one’s sure.\nMARTIN:         Anyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the island. They concluded that (Q24) the extinction happened 5,600 years ago, which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.\n————————-\nTUTOR:            So why don’t you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?\nMARTIN:         OK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.\nROSIE:             I’m not sure. I think (Q25) we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important …\nMARTIN:         You’re right.\nROSIE:             The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part, but we don’t have that much information, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe (Q26) we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team and ask him to tell us a bit more.\nMARTIN:          Great idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.\nROSIE:             We could (Q27) ask the audience to suggest some questions about it and then see how many of them we can answer. I don’t think it would take too long.\nTUTOR:            Yes that would add a bit of variety.\nMARTIN:         Then the section on further research carried out on the island – analysing the mud in the lake. I wonder if we’ve actually got too much information here, should we cut some?\nROSIE:             I don’t think so, but it’s all a bit muddled at present.\nMARTIN:         Yes, (Q28) maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern.\nROSIE:             I think so. The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practice it (Q29) so we’re sure it won’t overrun.\nMARTIN:          I think it should be OK, but yes, let’s make sure.\nTUTOR:            In the last section, relevance to the present day, you’ve got some good ideas but this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and (Q30) give your own viewpoint.\nMARTIN:         OK, we’ll think about that. Now shall we …\nSECTION 4\nIn this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting, I’ll start by examining its early history – that’ll be the subject of today’s talk.\nOk, so we’ll start by going back thousands of years. Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, played an important role in many creation myths. Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods, as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows. For instance, there’s the Egyptian sun god Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as (Q31) dances in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.\nBut the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important, in fact their (Q32) survival depended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of (Q33) clouds and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 (Q34) festivals, each associated with a different weather phenomenon.\nThe ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms. He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and (Q35) comets. Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions, such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth. Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.\n———————–\nFor nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red (Q36) sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate, as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.\nFor centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observation, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for (Q37) instruments. Until then, the only ones available were weather vanes – to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.\nIn 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first (Q38) thermometer. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure. In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686, and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.\nThis increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the eighteenth century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that (Q39) storms generally travel from west to east.\nIn addition to new meteorological instruments, other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of the (Q40) telegraph made it possible for these records to be collated. This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.\nIt was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point next week.\nTEST 3\nSECTION 1\nANGELA:         Hello, Flanders conference hotel.\nMAN:               Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about conference facilities at the hotel. Have I come through to the right person?\nANGELA:         You have. I’m the customer services manager. My name’s Angela. So how can I help you?\nMAN:               Well, I’m calling from Barrett and Stansons, we’re a medical company based in Perth.\nANGELA:         Oh yes.\nMAN:               And we’re organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney. It’ll be held over two days and we’re expecting about fifty or sixty people.\nANGELA:         When were you thinking of having it?\nMAN:               Some time early next year, like the end of January? It’d have to be a weekend^[It would have to be … → cách nói lịch sự để đặt điều kiện hoặc giới hạn về thời gian.].\nANGELA:         Let me see … our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January 28th. We could do the first weekend in February?\nMAN:               How about January 21st?\nANGELA:         I’m afraid^[I’m afraid: Cụm từ cố định trong tiếng Anh lịch sự, nghĩa “Rất tiếc / e rằng…”.] that’s booked too.\nMAN:               Well, let’s go for the February date then.\nANGELA:         So that’s the weekend beginning the 4th.\nMAN:               OK. Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?\nANGELA:         Sure. So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.\nMAN:               Sorry?\nANGELA:         Tesla – that’s spelled T-E-S-L-A. it holds up to a hundred people, and it’s fully equipped with a projector and so on.\nMAN:               How about a microphone?\nANGELA:         Yes, that’ll be all set up ready for you, and there’ll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.\nMAN:               Fine. And we’ll also need some sort of^[some sort of = “một loại / kiểu nào đó”.] open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee, and we’d like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well, so that’ll need to be quite a big space.\nANGELA:         That’s fine, there’s a central atrium with all those facilities, and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.\nMAN:               Great. And I presume there’s wifi?\nANGELA:         Oh yes, that’s free and available throughout the hotel.\nMAN:               OK.\nANGELA:         Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch? We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options^[a number of different options: với nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau].\nMAN:               What sort of price are we looking at for that?\nANGELA:         Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu. That’s 45 per person. Or you &lt;span class=&quot;htd&quot;&gt;can have&lt;/span&gt; the special for 25 more.\nMAN:               I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.\n———————–       \nMAN:               Now we’re also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants … I’m not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what do you change for a room?\nANGELA:         Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction, so we can offer you rooms at 135. Normally a standard &lt;span class=&quot;htd&quot;&gt;room’s&lt;/span&gt; 180.\nMAN:               And does that include breakfast?\nANGELA:         Sure. And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel. So we’ve got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on, and there’s a pool up on the roof for the use of guests.\nMAN:               Great. Now what about transport links? The hotel’s downtown, isn’t it?\nANGELA:          Yes, it’s about 12 kilometres from the airport, but there’s a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And it’s only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station.\nMAN:               OK. Now, I don’t know Sydney very well, can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?\nANGELA:         Well, it’s downtown on Wilby Street, that’s quite a small street, and it’s not very far from the sea. And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening there’s a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they want to make a night of it, they can go on to one of the clubs in the area – there are a great many to choose from.\nMAN:               OK. So if we go ahead with this, can you give me some information about how much …\nSECTION 2\nGood morning. My name’s Lucy Crittenden, and I’m the Director of Operations^[Director of Operations: giám đốc vận hành] for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I’m hoping I can persuade one or two of you^[one or two of you: một vài người trong số các bạn] to become volunteers yourselves. Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.\nVolunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way^[in some way: bằng một cách nào đó]. Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more. The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.\nVolunteers can do all sorts of things^[all sorts of things = đủ loại việc khác nhau], depending on^[depending on = tùy thuộc vào] their own abilities and interests^[abilities and interests = khả năng và mối quan tâm]. If they’re supporting a family that’s struggling^[a family that’s struggling = một gia đình mà (hiện tại) đang gặp khó khăn], for example, they may be able to give them tips on cooking, or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly on their income. They might even do some painting or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even do some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while^[for a while = trong chốc lát, một lúc].\nThe benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers also gain from it: they’re using their skills to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health^[ill health = sức khỏe kém], and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs: employers usually look favourably on^[look favourably on = đánh giá tích cực / nhìn nhận tốt về.] someone who’s given up time to help others. Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as many people don’t have that feeling.\n——————–\nNow I’d like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do, to give you an idea of the range of ways^[the range of ways = nhiều cách thức khác nhau] in which they can help people.\nHabib supports an elderly lady who’s beginning to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre, where a group of people come in and sing. The songs take the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.\nOur volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman. She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her. She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.\nMinh visits a young man who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own, so he hardly ever saw anyone. But together they go out to the cinema, or to see friends the young man hadn’t been able to visit for a long time.\nTanya visits an elderly woman once a week. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and the woman decided to try it herself. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.\nAlexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation. This has been great for their self-esteem.\nAnd the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t very good at talking to other people. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, and now the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people.\nOK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I’d like …\nSECTION 3\nLIZZIE:            So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?\nJOE:                 Well I’ve been put in charge of the school marching band, and it’s quite a responsibility. I’d like to talk it over with you.\nLIZZIE:             Go ahead. You’d better start by giving me a bit of background.\nJOE:                 OK. Well the band has students in it from all years, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about (Q21) 50 of them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.\nLIZZIE:              I can imagine.\nJOE:                 They aren’t really good enough to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a (Q22) regional one later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to try and improve.\nLIZZIE:             Yes, hopefully.\nJOE:                 Well, now the town council’s organising a (Q23) carnival in the summer, and the band has been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t really up to it yet, and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.\nLIZZIE:             Have you been doing anything with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.\nJOE:                 I played a recording I came across, of a (Q24) drummer talking about how playing in a band had changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.\nLIZZIE:             That’s good.\nJOE:                 I’m planning to show them that old (Q25) film from the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What do you think?\nLIZZIE:             Good idea. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.\nJOE:                 That’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m hoping I can take some of the band to a (Q26) parade that’s going to take place next month. A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.\nLIZZIE:             Mmm. They sound like good ideas to me.\nJOE:                 Thanks.\n—————————\nJOE:                 Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I’m finding it quite difficult to cope with? I’m sure you’ll have some ideas about what I can do.\nLIZZIE:             Go ahead.\nJOE:                 There’s a flautist who says she loves playing in the band. We rehearse twice a week after school, but (Q27) she’s hardly ever there. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.\nLIZZIE:             Oh dear! Any more students with difficulties?\nJOE:                 Plenty! There’s a trumpeter who thinks she’s the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn’t. (Q28) She’s always saying what she thinks other people should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.\nLIZZIE:             She sounds a bit of a nightmare!\nJOE:                 You can say that again. One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm, and could be an excellent musician – except that (Q29) he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really have enough breath for the trombone. He’d be much better of playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.\nLIZZIE:             I suppose you have to admire his determination.\nJOE:                 Maybe. One of the percussionists isn’t too bad, but (Q30) he never seems to interact with other people, and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends. I don’t know if there are family reasons, or what. But it isn’t good in a band, where people really need to feel they’re part of a group.\nLIZZIE:             Hmm.\nJOE:                 There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I’m up against. Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?\nSECTION 4\nAs you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year, and here in the music department we’ve planned three concerts. These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and Australian composers. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.\nThe first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano – like so many children – and also the (Q31) violin. But when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in other countries. As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras, other performers and festivals in several countries.\nLiza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of (Q32) energy, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is (Q33) complex, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.\nIn the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia. This is an (Q34) opera in seven parts, based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also (Q35) disturbing, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.\n——————————-\nMoving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by British composers – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The Tower of Remoteness. According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek, overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees, listening to the birds and insects. The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and (Q36) clarinet. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.\nRoss Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s well known in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a wide range of music, from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children. Edward’s music has been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the (Q37) diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.\nThe last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study (Q38) physics, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer. Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for (Q39) dance, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.\nIn our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the (Q40) Olympics held in 1996. This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide, and we’ll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.\nTEST 4\nSECTION 1\nANDREW:        Good morning, Clare House Hotel. Andrew speaking. I’m the Events Manager.\nSAM:               Good morning, Andrew. My name’s Samantha. I’m arranging a party for my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, and I’m ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September. Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.          \nANDREW:        OK, I’m sure we can help you with that. Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?\nSAM:               Probably a sit-down.\nANDREW:        And do you know how many people there’ll be?\nSAM:               Around eighty, I think.\nANDREW:        Well we have two rooms that can hold that number. One is the Adelphi Room. That can seat eighty-five, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.\nSAM:               Right.\nANDREW:        If you have live music, there’s room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room. Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing, but not too loud for conversation.\nSAM:               Yes, I really don’t like it when you can’t talk.\nANDREW:        Exactly. Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel, and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace. This has a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year.\nSAM:               Which direction does it face?\nANDREW:        Southwest, so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.\nSAM:               Very nice.\nANDREW:        From the terrace you can see the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel, or you can stroll through there to the river – that’s on the far side, so it isn’t visible from the hotel.\nSAM:               OK.\nANDREW:        Then another option is the Carlton Room. This is a bit bigger – it can hold up to a hundred and ten people – and it has the advantage of a stage, which is useful if you have any entertainment, or indeed a small band can fit onto it.\nSAM:               And can you go outside from the room?\nANDREW:        No, the Carlton Room is on the first floor, but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.\nSAM:               Lovely. I think either of those rooms would be suitable.\nANDREW:        Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?\nSAM:               Please do.\nANDREW:        As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, who’ll be with you throughout the party.\nSAM:               What exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a speech during the meal if we need one, do they?\nANDREW:        That’s right. All our MCs are trained as public speakers, so they can easily get people’s attention – many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter! And they’re also your support – if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.\nSAM:               Great! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you also have any other accommodation, like cabins, for example?\nANDREW:        Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.\nSAM:               That sounds perfect for what we’ll need.\n——————————\nSAM:               Now you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all included in the price of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.\nANDREW:        Normally you’d be able to use it, but it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I’m afraid. The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge. That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.\nSAM:               Right.\nANDREW:        And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those. We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!\nSAM:               Right. Now could we discuss the food? This would be dinner, around seven o’clock …\nSECTION 2\nHello everyone. I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your rep^[rep = viết tắt của representative (người đại diện)] here at the hotel. I’m sure you’ll all have a great time here. So let me tell you a bit about what’s on offer. I’ll start by telling you about some of the excursions^[some of the excursions = một vài chuyến tham quan] that are available for guests.\nOne thing you have to do while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you’ll see dolphins – if you don’t you can repeat the trip free of charge. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately there aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip, but come and see me to book for later in the week.\nIf you’re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches. There’s some fairly steep climbs up the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains. It’s just 25 euros all inclusive, and it’s every Wednesday.\nThen on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back – it’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres so this isn’t really for inexperienced cyclists as you’ll be going pretty fast. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll have fantastic views.\nOn our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the best thing about this trip is that it’s completely free. You’ll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s entirely up to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you’ll return by 6 pm.\nIf you’re interested in astronomy you may already know that the island’s one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90 euros per person and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work. Afterwards we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.\nFinally, there’s horse riding. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, or even if you’ve never been on a horse before. They take you down to the beach, and you can canter along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35 euros and it’s available every day.\n———————————-\nSo there’s plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?\nWell, the number one attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites’. Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas and finally Copacabana. At the end the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes, and you’ll have a chance to chat with them. It’s hugely popular^[ugely popular = rất được ưa chuộng / phổ biến rộng rãi], so let me know now if you’re interested because it’s no good leaving it until the last minute^[until the last minute → cụm cố định nghĩa là “đến phút chót / phút cuối cùng”]. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.\nIf you’d like to go back in time, there’s the Castle Feast on Saturday evening. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. You’re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery, and you’re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses. Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and join in as well if you want. OK, so now if anyone …\nSECTION 3\nSTEPHANIE:     Hello, Trevor.\nTREVOR:          Hello, Stephanie. You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.\nSTEPHANIE:     That’s right. I’m thinking of doing it next year, but I’d like to find out more about it first.\nTREVOR:          OK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them. One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.\nSTEPHANIE:     You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.\nTREVOR:          Right, and whether the teaching should be factual – giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that (Q21) the writer isn’t necessarily conscious of the message they’re conveying. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.\nSTEPHANIE:     I see what you mean.\nTREVOR:          That module made me realise how important stories are – they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up. Actually, (Q22) it inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own interest. I know can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re very good, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.\nSTEPHANIE:     Mm. I’m very interested in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?\nTREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes central to the story.\nSTEPHANIE:     That’s good. I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so (Q23) that’s the field I want to go into when I finish the course. I bet that module will be really helpful.\nTREVOR:          I’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.\nSTEPHANIE:     But children are so used to visual input – on TV, video games, and so on. There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think (Q24) comics can serve a really useful purpose.\nTREVOR:          You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just think its sad when children don’t read books.\nSTEPHANIE:     What about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?\nTREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and played with dolls. I was amazed (Q25) how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.\nSTEPHANIE:     That’s true. So it sounds as though you think it’s a good course.\nTREVOR:          Definitely.\n———————————-\nTREVOR:          Have you been reading lots of children’s stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?\nSTEPHANIE:     Yeah. I’ve gone as far back as the late seventeenth century, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.\nTREVOR:          So does that mean you’ve read Perrault’s fairy tales? Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.\nSTEPHANIE:     Yes. They must be important, (Q26) because no stories of that type had been written before, there were the first. Then there’s The Swiss Family Robinson.\nTREVOR:          I haven’t read that.\nSTEPHANIE:     The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about (Q27) a Swiss family who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.\nTREVOR:          Well I never knew that!\nSTEPHANIE:     Have you read Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?\nTREVOR:          Wasn’t that (Q28) the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker?\nSTEPHANIE:     That’s right. It has some quite bizarre elements.\nTREVOR:          I hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of all time.\nSTEPHANIE:     Mine too! And it’s so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays, and most of them are very witty, but The Happy Prince is really moving. (Q29) I struggled with Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings – there long books, and I gave up after one.\nTREVOR:          It’s extremely popular, though.\nSTEPHANIE:     Yeah, but whereas something like The Happy Prince just carried me along with it, The Lord of the Rings took more effort than I was prepared to give it.\nTREVOR:          I didn’t find that – I love it.\nSTEPHANIE:     Another one I’ve read is War Horse.\nTREVOR:          Oh yes. It’s about the First Word War, isn’t it? (Q30) Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story.\nSTEPHANIE:     Exactly, but it’s been very successful. Have you read any …\nSECTION 4\nIn today’s class I’m going to talk about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.\nAtlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an impressive monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a (Q31) spring, that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.\nAtlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami, or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea. It’s been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.\nFor marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove. Research on the buildings, (Q32) tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world. For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements, but the hard part is finding them.\nUnderwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts, but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed, some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous, which means they don’t need to be operated by a person.\nAutonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create (Q33) maps of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so (Q34) heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.\n————————\nBut the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre – they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They’re also very sophisticated. They can communicate with each other and, for example, work out the most efficient way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.\nField tests show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the sixth century AD while ferrying prefabricated (Q35) marble elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.\nCreating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves, but in water these will only travel a few centimetres. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share date using (Q36) light, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. But more creative solutions are also being developed, where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV, which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.\nThere’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries superior (Q37) cameras, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.\nMarine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. One site where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying (Q38) medical goods, in wooden or tin receptacles. Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the (Q39) eyes.\nOther Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held (Q40) wine. In many cases it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.\nAnother project that’s about to …"},"IELTS/Audioscripts-Cam-15-Listening":{"slug":"IELTS/Audioscripts-Cam-15-Listening","filePath":"IELTS/Audioscripts Cam 15 Listening.md","title":"Audioscripts Cam 15 Listening","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"TEST 1\nPART 1\nAMBER:               Hello William. This is Amber – you said to phone^[you said to phone = you said (that I should) phone] if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned^[the job agency you mentioned = công ty môi giới việc làm mà bạn nhắc đến]. Is now a good time?\nWILLIAM:            Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside – they’re based in^[be based in: cách nói trang trọng hơn located in] Docklands – I can tell you the address now – 497 Eastside.\nAMBER:               OK, thanks. So is there anyone in particular^[anyone in particular → “một người nào đó cụ thể”] I should speak to there?\nWILLIAM:            The agent^[The agent who/that I always deal with] I always deal with^[deal with somebody = làm việc/giải quyết với ai đó] is called Becky Jamieson.\nAMBER:               Let me write that down – Becky …\nWILLIAM:            Jamieson (Q1) J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.\nAMBER:               Do you have her direct line^[số điện thoại trực tiếp]?\nWILLIAM:            Yes, it’s in my contacts somewhere – right, here we are: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I wouldn’t call her until the afternoon if I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s really helpful and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth^[it would be worth: Cấu trúc mang nghĩa đáng để làm gì] getting in touch with her^[getting in touch with her: Cụm động từ, có nghĩa là liên lạc với cô ấy hoặc kết nối với cô ấy] for an informal chat^[an informal chat: một cuộc trò chuyện thân mật].\nAMBER:               It’s mainly clerical and admin jobs^[clerical and admin jobs: công việc hành chính văn phòng] they deal with, isn’t it?\nWILLIAM:            That’s right. I know you’re hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually – but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff^[temporary staff: nhân viên tạm thời] for the finance sector^[finance sector: nghành tài chính] – which will look good on your CV – and generally pays better too.\nAMBER:               Yeah – I’m just a bit worried because I don’t have much office experience.\nWILLIAM:            I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist^[receptionist: nhân viên lễ tân], or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s communication that really matters – so you’d be fine there. And you’ll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It’s not that complicated.\nAMBER:               OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.\nWILLIAM:            That shouldn’t be too difficult. But you’re more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended. It’s unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.\nAMBER:               Right, I’ve heard the pay isn’t too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.\nWILLIAM:            Oh yes – definitely. The hourly rate is about £10, 11 if you’re lucky.\nAMBER:               That’s pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.\n————————————————\nWILLIAM:            Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?\nAMBER:               Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview.\nWILLIAM:            The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance^[about a week in advance (trước khoảng một tuần)].\nAMBER:               I suppose I should dress smartly if it’s for office work – I can probably borrow a suit from Mum.\nWILLIAM:            Good idea. It’s better to look too smart than too casual.\nAMBER:               Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?\nWILLIAM:            No – they don’t need to see those, I don’t think.\nAMBER:               What about my passport?\nWILLIAM:            Oh yes – they will ask to see that.\nAMBER:               OK.\nWILLIAM:            I wouldn’t get stressed about the interview though. It’s just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you’ll like. So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates – fairly basic ones. And they probably won’t ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.\nAMBER:               Hope not.\nWILLIAM:            Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview will be useful because they’ll give you feedback on your performance so you can improve next time.\nAMBER:               And they’ll have access to jobs which aren’t advertised.\nWILLIAM:            Exactly – most temporary jobs aren’t advertised.\nAMBER:               And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time – it’s much easier than ringing up individual companies.\nWILLIAM:            Yes indeed. Well I think …\nPART 2\nGood morning. My name’s Erica Matthews, and I’m the owner of Matthews Island Holidays, a company set up by my parents. Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer. We’re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don’t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our many years’ experience – more than almost any other rail holiday company (Q11) – to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations, which we’ve got to know extremely well.\nI’ll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you (Q12), then you’ll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man. Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead, and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.\nYou have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips (Q13): day four is free, and most people have lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.\nThe price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned. Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six months in advance or at the last minute, and there’s no supplement for single rooms in hotels. If you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee. (Q14)\n——————————-\nOK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on day one you’ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The dining room looks out at the river (Q15), close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.\nOn day two you’ll take the coach to the small town of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The Isle of Man isn’t part of the United Kingdom, and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald. It’s claimed that this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s still functioning, and that it dates back to 979. However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422 (Q16), so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!\nDay three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey. From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top (Q17). Lunch will be in the café, giving you spectacular views of the island.\nDay four is free for you to explore, using the pass (Q18) which we’ll give you. So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s heritage sites. Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.\nThe last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the steam (Q19) railway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After some time to explore, a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man, a small island just off the coast. From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the capital (Q20) of the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.\nAnd on day six it’s back to the ferry – or the airport, if you flew to the island – and time to go home.\nNow I’d like to tell you …\nPART 3\nRUTH:   Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?\nED:         Well, OK, Ruth – but there’s so much of it.\nRUTH:   I know, I hadn’t realised birth order was such a popular area of research.\nED:         But the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable. From what I’ve been reading a lot of claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes, with no robust evidence to support them.\nRUTH:   OK, but that’s an interesting point – we could start by outlining what previous research has shown. There are studies going back over a hundred years.\nED:         Yeah – so we could just run through some of the typical traits. Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.\nRUTH:   Right, but on a positive note, some studies claimed that they were thought to be good a nurturing – certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones. (Q21)\nED:         There isn’t such a clear picture for middle children – but one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.\nRUTH:   Generally eager to please and helpful (Q22) – although that’s certainly not accurate as far as my family goes – my middle brother was a nightmare – always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.\nED:         As I said – none of this seems to relate to my own experience. I’m the youngest in my family and I don’t recognise myself in any of the studies I’ve read about. I’m supposed to have been a sociable and confident child who made friends easily (Q23) – but I was actually terribly shy.\nRUTH:   Really? That’s funny. There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…\nED:         There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in social situations (Q24) because they always have their twin around to depend on for support.\nRUTH:   My cousins were like that when they were small – they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids. They’re fine now though.\nED:         Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them (Q25) because they’ve never had to fight for their parents’ attention.\nRUTH:   That does seem a bit harsh. One category I hadn’t considered before was children with much older siblings – a couple of studies mentioned that these children grow up more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves – like getting dressed. (Q26)\nED:         I can see how that might be true – although I expect they’re sometimes the exact opposite – playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.\n——————————–\nRUTH:   What was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?\nED:         I think it was because in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family, who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.\nRUTH:   Mmm. Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though. Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings. This has been proved in lots of recent studies.\nED:         Yes. Although what many of them didn’t take into consideration was family size (Q27). The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socioeconomic status – which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.\nRUTH:   The oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.\nED:         Exactly.\nRUTH:   But the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age – which is what I would have expected. It’s that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes. (Q28)\nED:         Right, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contribute, in a small way, to better performance.\nSo would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?\nRUTH:   I think so – my younger brother was incredibly annoying and we found a lot but I think this has made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself (Q29/Q30). We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him – but we had to put up with each other (Q29/Q30) and most of the time we co-existed amicably enough.\nED:         Yes, my situation was pretty similar. But I don’t think having two older brothers made me any less selfish – I was never prepared to let me brothers use any of my stuff …\nRUTH:   That’s perfectly normal, whereas …\nPART 4\nToday I’m going to talk about the eucalyptus tree. This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it’s also sometimes called the gum tree. First I’m going to talk about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe some problems it faces at present.\nRight, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives shelter (Q31) to creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil (Q32) extracted from eucalyptus leaves.\nThe eucalyptus grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to four hundred years. So it’s alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?\nOne possible reason is disease. As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of roads (Q33). The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby. What is was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.\nBut this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees. By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia’s East Coast, of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners. Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected. What happens is that insects (Q34) settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it. The bell-miner birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it. So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.\n————————–\nBut experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Die-back. So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation. One possibility is that it’s to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 years ago be ecologist William Jackson is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there. If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages grass (Q35) to grow afterwards, while if the bushfires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.\nSo why is this? Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume water (Q36) needed by eucalyptus trees. And there’s another reason. If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way, by affecting the composition of the soil (Q37), and removing nutrients from it. So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive as long as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.\nBut since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels had led to what’s known as ‘dry (Q38) rainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions. And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a simple (Q39) one. It has very thick, dense vegetation, but not much variety of species. The vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its nests (Q40) in the undergrowth there. But again that’s not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.\nTEST 2\nPART 1\nTIM:       Good morning. You’re through to^[“be through to” (khi gọi điện thoại) = bạn đã được kết nối với …] the tourist information office, Tim speaking. How can I help you?\nJEAN:     Oh hello. Could you give me some information about next month’s festival, please? My family and I will be staying in the town that week.\nTIM:       Of course. Well it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.\nJEAN:     Oh I heard about that. The orchestra and singers^[The orchestra and singers = dàn nhạc và ca sĩ] come from the USA, don’t they?\nTIM:       They’re from Canada. They’re very popular over there. They’re going to perform a number of well-known pieces^[well-known pieces = những tác phẩm nổi tiếng] that will appeal to children as well as adults.\nJEAN:     That sounds good. My whole family^[My whole family = cả gia đình tôi] are interested in music.\nTIM:       The next day, the 18th, there’s a performance by a ballet company called Eustatis.\nJEAN:     Sorry?\nTIM:       The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S. They appeared in last year’s festival, and went down very well^[went down very well = được đón nhận (tốt/xấu) bởi khán giả/người nghe]. Again, their programme^[programme = program] is designed for all ages.\nJEAN:     Good. I expect we’ll go to that. I hope there’s going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.\nTIM:       You’re in luck! On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group^[a local amateur group = một nhóm nghiệp dư địa phương] are performing one written by a member of group. It’s called Jemima. That’ll be on in the town hall^[in the town hall = ở tòa thị chính]. They’ve already performed it two or three times. I haven’t seen it myself, but the review in the local paper^[in the local paper = trên tờ báo địa phương] was very good.\nJEAN:     And is it suitable for children?\nTIM:       Yes, in fact it’s aimed more at children than at adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.\nJEAN:     And what about dance? Will there be any performances?\nTIM:       Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces, with electronic music by young composers.\nJEAN:     Uh-huh.\nTIM:       The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other, so it’s got^[it’s got = (cách nói thân mật, Anh-Anh) = it has] the rather strange name^[the rather strange name = cái tên khá lạ], Chat.\nJEAN:     I suppose that’s because that’s something we do both face to face and online.\nTIM:       That’s right.\n———————-\nTIM:       Now there are also some workshops and other activities. They’ll all take place at least once every day, so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.\nJEAN:     Good. We’re particularly interested in cookery – you don’t happen to have^[Happen to V = làm một việc gì đó một cách hoàn toàn tình cờ, không tính trước] a cookery workshop, do you?\nTIM:       We certainly do. It’s going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle, and it’ll show that even sweet things like cakes^[even sweet things like cakes → ngay cả những món ngọt như bánh] can contain much less sugar than they usually do.\nJEAN:     That might be worth going^[be worth doing sth → cấu trúc: đáng để làm gì] to. We’re trying to encourage our children to cook.\nTIM:       Another workshop is just for children, and that’s on creating posters to reflect the history of the town. The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives have changed over the centuries. The results will be exhibited in the community centre. Then the other workshop is in toy-making, and that’s for adults only.\nJEAN:     Oh, why’s that?\nTIM:       Because it involves carpentry – participants will be making toys out of wood, so there’ll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.\nJEAN:     It makes sense to keep children away from it.\nTIM:       Exactly. Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities. There’ll be supervised wild swimming …\nJEAN:     Wild swimming? What’s that?\nTIM:       It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.\nJEAN:     Oh OK. In a lake, for instance.\nTIM:       Yes, there’s a beautiful one just outside the town^[just outside the town → ngay bên ngoài thị trấn], and that’ll be the venue for the swimming. There’ll be lifeguards on duty, so it’s suitable for all ages. And finally, there’ll be a walk in some nearby woods every day. The leader is an expert on insects. He’ll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment. So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.\nJEAN:     There certainly are.\nTIM:       If you’d like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going, the festival organizer is keeping a blog. Just search online for the festival website, and you’ll find it.\nJEAN:     Well, thank you very much for all the information.\nTIM:       You’re welcome. Goodbye.\nJEAN:     Goodbye.\nPART 2\nWOMAN:\nI’m very pleased to welcome this evening’s guest speaker, Mark Logan, who’s going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park. Over to you, Mark.\n———————–\nMARK:\nThank you. I’m sure you’re all familiar with Minster Park. It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century, and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time. What perhaps isn’t so well known is the origin of the park: unlike many public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some waste land, which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892 (Q11). It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn’t settled until 20 years later, when the council took possession of it.\nYou may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances. It’s of Diane Gosforth, who played a key role in the history of the park. Once the council had become the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many local people (Q12) wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment – remember the park is in a densely populated residential area. Diane Gosforth was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations (Q12), which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.\nSoon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables (Q13), which were sold locally. At one stage the army considered taking in over for troop exercises and got as far as contacting the city council, then decided the park was too small to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an area that had been retained as grass.\nAfter the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged until recently. Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times, most recently in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work had started. The changes finally got going in 2016 (Q14), and were finished on schedule last year.\n————————–\nOK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made – and some things that have been retained. If you look at this map, you’ll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved: it used to be close to the south gate, but it’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond, almost in the centre of the park (Q15), which makes it much more visible.\nThere’s a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank, where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend. (Q16)\nThere are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that’s between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river. (Q17)\nThen there’s a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges. That’s near the west gate – you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it. (Q18)\nThere have been tennis courts in the park for many years, and they’ve been doubled, from four to eight. They’re still in the south-west corner of the park, where there’s a right-angle bend in the path. (Q19)\nSomething else I’d like to mention is the new fitness area. This is right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate. (Q20)\nNow, as you’re all gardeners, I’m sure you’ll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.\nPART 3\nCATHY:                 OK, Graham, so let’s check we both know what we’re supposed to be doing.\nGRAHAM:            OK.\nCATHY:                 So, for the university’s open day, we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.\nGRAHAM:            That’s right. But we’ll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up, remember – for the moment, we just need to plan it.\nCATHY:                 Good. So have you gathered who’s expected to come and see the display? Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments? I’m not clear about it.\nGRAHAM:            Nor me. That was how it used to be, but it didn’t attract many people, so this year it’s going to be part of an open day, to raise the university’s profile. It’ll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what does on here (Q21/Q22). And it’s included in the information that’s sent to people who are considering applying to study here next year. (Q21/Q22)\nCATHY:                 Presumably some current students and lecturers will come?\nGRAHAM:            I would imagine so, but we’ve been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.\nCATHY:                 Right. We don’t have to cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?\nGRAHAM:            No, it’s entirely up to us. I suggest just using Charles Dickens.\nCATHY:                 That’s a good idea. Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels, or seen films based on them (Q23/Q24), so that’s a good lead-in to life in his time.\nGRAHAM:            Exactly. And his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in, don’t they: he wanted to shock people into doing something about it. (Q23/Q24)\nCATHY:                 Did he do any campaigning, other than writing?\nGRAHAM:            Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks, but I’m inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.\nCATHY:                 Yes, I agree.\n————————–\nCATHY:                 OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?\nGRAHAM:            Yes. I’ve printed out a list of Dicken’s novels in the order they were published, in the hope you’d agree to focus on him!\nCATHY:                 You’re lucky I did agree! Let’s have a look. OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. It was very successful when it came out, wasn’t it, and was adapted for the theatre straight away.\nGRAHAM:            There’s an interesting point, though, that there’s a character who keeps falling asleep, and that medical condition was named after the book – Pickwickian Syndrome. (Q25)\nCATHY:                 Oh, so why don’t we use that as the topic, and include some quotations from the novel?\nGRAHAM:            Right, Next is Oliver Twist. There’s a lot in the novel about poverty. But maybe something less obvious …\nCATHY:                 Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn’t he? We could use that to illustrate the fact that very few children went to school, particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways. (Q26)\nGRAHAM:            Good idea. What’s next?\nCATHY:                 Maybe Nicholas Nickleby. Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn’t he?\nGRAHAM:            That’s right. But there’s also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins. We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time. (Q27) We don’t want only the bad things, do we?\nCATHY:                 OK.\nGRAHAM:            What about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, doesn’t he?\nCATHY:                 Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before, and drew on his experience there in the novel. (Q28)\nGRAHAM:            I wonder, though … The main theme is selfishness, so we could do something on social justice? No, too general, let’s keep to your idea – I think it would work well.\nCATHY:                 He wrote Bleak House next – that’s my favourite of his novels.\nGRAHAM:            Yes, mine too. His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.\nCATHY:                 That’s true, but think about Esther, the heroine. As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt, who treats her very badly. Then she’s very happy living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household. And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house, where of course they’re very happy. (Q29)\nGRAHAM:            Yes, I like that.\nCATHY:                 What shall we take next? Little Dorrit? Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors’ prison for years …\nGRAHAM:            So was Dicken’s father, wasn’t he?\nCATHY:                 That’s right.\nGRAHAM:            What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune, and he starts pretending he’s always been rich? (Q30)\nCATHY:                 Good idea.\nGRAHAM:            OK, so next we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue. That’s going to be quite hard.\nPART 4\nI’m going to report on a case study of a programme which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique, a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.\nThe programme worked with three communities in Chicualacuala district, near the Limpopo River. This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term, as they were rapidly using up this resource.\nTo support agriculture in this dry region, the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River by setting up systems of irrigation (Q31), which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals. The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this. The region already had one farmers’ association, and it was decided to set up two more of these. These associations planned and carried out activities including water management, livestock breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general, women (Q32) formed the majority of the workforce.\nIt was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was responsible for creating these fences, but the programme provided the necessary wire (Q33) for making them.\nOnce the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the programme provided the necessary seeds (Q34) for this. The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the labour was all provided by local people, and they also provided and put up the posts (Q35) that supported the fences around the fields.\n———————-\nOnce the programme had been set up, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to grow enough produce not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not have access to transport (Q36), and this resulted in large amounts of produce, especially vegetables, being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers’ associations and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation. (Q37)\nThere was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned, but which became a central feature of the programme. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish (Q38) – an important source of protein. After a time, another suggestion was made by local people which hadn’t been part of the programme’s original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They decided to try setting up colonies of bees (Q39), which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.\nSo what lessons can be learned from this programme? First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income. However, it’s important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme, especially for its design (Q40), as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.\nThe programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where …\nTEST 3\nPART 1\nSALLY:   Good morning. Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe. I’m one of the agency representatives, and my name’s Sally Baker.\nJOE:       Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn’t we?\nSALLY:   That’s right, we did. So thank you for sending in your CV. We’ve had quite a careful look at it and I think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.\nJOE:       OK.\nSALLY:   The first one is in a company based in North London. They’re looking for an administrative assistant.\nJOE:       OK. What sort of company is it?\nSALLY:   They’re called Home Solutions and they design and make furniture. (Q1)\nJOE:       Oh, I don’t know much about that, but it sounds interesting.\nSALLY:   Yes, well as I said, they want someone in their office, and looking at your past experience it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements. So on your CV it appears you’ve done some data entry?\nJOE:       Yes.\nSALLY:   So that’s one skill they want. Then they expect the person they appoint to attend meetings (Q2) and take notes there …\nJOE:       OK. I’ve done that before, yes.\nSALLY:   And you’d need to be able to cope with general admin.\nJOE:       Filling, and keeping records and so on? That should be OK. And in my last job I also had to manage the diary. (Q3)\nSALLY:   Excellent. That’s something they want here too. I’d suggest you add it to your CV – I don’t think you mentioned that, did you?\nJOE:       No.\nSALLY:   So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course, and they particularly mention spreadsheets.\nJOE:       That should be fine.\nSALLY:   And interpersonal skills – which would be something they’d check with your references.\nJOE:       I think that should be OK, yes.\nSALLY:   Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with details (Q4) – just looking at your CV, I’d say you’re probably alright there.\nJOE:       I think so, yes. Do they want any special experience?\nSALLY:   I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.\nJOE:       I’ve got three years’ experience of that.\nSALLY:   let’s see, yes, good. In fact they’re only asking for at least one year (Q5), so that’s great. So is that something that might interest you?\nJOE:       It is, yes. The only thing is, you said they were in North London so it would be quite a long commute for me.\nSALLY:   OK.\n————————\nSALLY:   So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes; that’s for a warehouse assistant and that’s in South London.\nJOE:       Yes, that would be a lot closer.\nSALLY:   And you’ve worked in a warehouse before, haven’t you?\nJOE:       Yes.\nSALLY:   So as far as the responsibilities for this position go, they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also deliveries. (Q6)\nJOE:       That should be OK. You’ve got to keep track of stuff, but I’ve always been quite good with numbers.\nSALLY:   Good, that’s their first requirement. And they want someone who’s computer literate, which we know you are.\nJOE:       Sure.\nSALLY:   Then they mention organisational skills. They want someone who’s well organised.\nJOE:       Yes, I think I am.\nSALLY:   And tidy? (Q7)\nJOE:       Yes, they go together really, don’t they?\nSALLY:   Sure. Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.\nJOE:       OK. And for the last warehouse job I had, one of the things I enjoyed most was being part of a team (Q8). I found that was really essential for the job.\nSALLY:   Excellent. Yes, they do mention that they want someone who’s used to that, yes. Now when you were working in a warehouse last time, what sorts of items were you dealing with?\nJOE:       It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment, sinks and stoves and fridges.\nSALLY:   So you’re OK moving heavy (Q9) things?\nJOE:       Sure. I’m quite strong, and I’ve had the training.\nSALLY:   Good. Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence, and that you have experience of driving in London – so you can cope with the traffic and so on.\nJOE:       Yes, no problem.\nSALLY:   And you’ve got experience of warehouse work … and the final thing they mention is customer (Q10) service. I think looking at your CV you’ve OK there.\nJOE:       Right. So what about pay? Can you tell me a bit more about that, please …\nPART 2\nPRESENTER:\nMy guest on the show today is Alice Riches who started the Street Play Scheme where she lives in Beechwood Road. For those of you that don’t already know – Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours so that children have a chance to play in the street safely. She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road, and the idea caught on, and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?\nALICE:\nWell, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler, so that’s about six years ago now – but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen. So the scheme’s been up and running for three years now (Q11). We’d love to be able to close our road for longer – for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example. At the moment it’s just once a week (Q12). But when we started it was only once a month. But we’re working on it.\nPRESENTER:\nSo what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?\nALICE:\nWe have volunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end (Q13). The council have provided special signs but there’s always a volunteer there to explain what’s happening to any motorists. Generally, they’re fine about it – we’ve only had to get the police involved once or twice.\nNow I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars. But only residents’ cars are allowed. If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road, it’s not a problem – as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour (Q14). But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time, or they park in another street. The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.\nPRESENTER:\nSo can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?\nALICE:\nAbsolutely – we want to include all kids in the city – especially those who live on busy roads (Q15). It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas where the children have access to parks or large gardens – or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.\nI’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go. We’ve been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city. And that’s not just parents. There are always a few who complain but they’re a tiny minority. On the whole everyone is very supportive and say they’re very happy to see children out on the street (Q16) – even if it does get quite noisy.\n——————-\nALICE:\nThere have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids. Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they’re not doing anything particularly energetic. And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents – but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents (Q17/Q18). The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street – it’s like having a big extended family (Q17/Q18).\nPRESENTER:\nIt certainly does have a lot of benefits. I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.\nALICE:\nRight. Well this was an experiment I was involved in where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street, which is the busiest main road in our area, by persuading people not to use their cars for one day. We thought about making people pay more for parking – but we decided that would be really unpopular – so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street but left the other car parks open.\nIt was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we’d predicted, air quality was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was how much quieter it would be (Q19/Q20) – even with the buses still running. Of course everyone said they felt safer but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day (Q19/Q20) – we thought there’d be fewer people out shopping – not more.\nPRESENTER:\nThat’s really interesting so the fact that …\nPART 3\nHAZEL:  Tom, could I ask you for some advice, please?\nTOM:     Yes of course, if you think I can help. What’s it about?\nHAZEL:  It’s my first media studies assignment, and I’m not sure how to go about it. You must have done it last year.\nTOM:     Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?\nHAZEL:  That’s right.\nTOM:     Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.\nHAZEL:  So what sort of things do I need to compare?\nTOM:     Well, there are several things. For example, there’s the question of which page (Q21) of the newspaper the item appears on.\nHAZEL:  You mean, because there’s a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?\nTOM:     Exactly. And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is. Then there’s the size (Q22) – how many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.\nHAZEL:  And I suppose that includes the headline.\nTOM:     It certainly does. It’s all part of attracting the reader’s attention.\nHAZEL:  What about graphics (Q23) – whether there’s anything visual in addition to the text?\nTOM:     Yes, you need to consider those, too, because they can have a big effect on the reader’s understanding of the story – sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself. Then you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what structure (Q24) is it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end, where people probably won’t read it?\nHAZEL:  And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don’t they? Either deliberately or by accident. Should I be looking at that, too?\nTOM:     Yes, if you can. Compare what’s in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what’s true and what isn’t. And that relates to a very important point: what’s the writer’s purpose (Q25), or at least the most important one, if they have several. It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous.\nHAZEL:  Gosh, I see what you mean. And I suppose the writer may make assumptions (Q26) about the reader.\nTOM:     That’s right – about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised. All of that will make a difference to how story is presented.\n———————-\nHAZEL:  Does it matter what type of story I write about?\nTOM:     No – national or international politics, the arts … Anything, as long as it’s covered in two or three newspaper. Though of course it’ll be easier and more fun if it’s something you’re interested in and know something about.\nHAZEL:  And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing – I’m quite keen on politics, so I’ll try and find a suitable topic (Q27). What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?\nTOM:     I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly, so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers, but when I started looking. I couldn’t find two on the same topic (Q28) that I felt like analysing.\nHAZEL:  In that case, I won’t even bother to look (Q28).\nTOM:     So in the end I chose a human interest story – a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill, and lots of other people – mostly strangers – raised money so she could go abroad for treatment. Actually, I was surprised – some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like why treatment wasn’t available here.\nHAZEL:  Hmm, I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me! I’ll avoid that (Q29). Perhaps I’ll choose an arts topic (Q30), like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts – I’ll think about that.\nTOM:     Yes, that might be interesting.\nHAZEL:  OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It’s been really useful.\nTOM:     You’re welcome. Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.\nPART 4\nNowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning, but this is very much a 20th-century development.\nThe origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times. Since water is essential for life, the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties – at least that it rinsed mud off (Q31) their hands.\nDuring the excavation of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay (Q32), with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with askes. This is a method of making soap, though there’s no reference to the purpose of this material.\nThe early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn’t use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil (Q33). They also used oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams.\nThe ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their hair red (Q34).\nSoap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the River Tiber. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.\nAs Roman civilisation advance, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their aqueducts (Q35), was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular. And by the second century AD, the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleaning purposes.\n————————–\nAfter the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of disease (Q36) in the Middle Ages, and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.\nNevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe, and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with perfume, apparently for the first time (Q37). Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.\nA major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash (Q38), or sodium carbonate. Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap. The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.\nModern soapmaking was born some 20 years later, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soapmaking became a science (Q39). Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.\nUntil the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in several countries. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed (Q40). Soap was then something ordinary people could afford, and cleanliness standards improved.\nWith this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.\nTEST 4\nPART 1\nMAN:                    Hello. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today? We’re doing a customer satisfaction survey.\nSOPHIE:               Yes. OK. I’ve got about ten minutes before my train home leaves. I’m on a day trip.\nMAN:                    Great. Thank you. So first of all, could you tell me your name?\nSOPHIE:               It’s Sophie Bird.\nMAN:                    Thank you. And would you mind telling me what you do?\nSOPHIE:               I’m a journalist. (Q1)\nMAN:                    Oh really? That must be interesting.\nSOPHIE:               Yes. It is.\nMAN:                    So was the reason for your visit here today work?\nSOPHIE:               Actually, it’s my day off. I came here to do some shopping. (Q2)\nMAN:                    On right.\nSOPHIE:               But I do sometimes come here for work.\nMAN:                    OK. Now I’d like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that’s OK.\nSOPHIE:               Yes. No problem.\nMAN:                    Right, so can you tell me which station you’re travelling back to?\nSOPHIE:               Staunfirth (Q3), where I live.\nMAN:                    Can I just check the spelling? S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H?\nSOPHIE:               That’s right.\nMAN:                    And you travelled from there this morning?\nSOPHIE:               Yes.\nMAN:                    OK, good. Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought? I assume it wasn’t a season ticket, as you don’t travel every day.\nSOPHIE:               That’s right. No, I just got a normal return (Q4) ticket. I don’t have a rail card so I didn’t get any discount. I keep meaning to get one because it’s a lot cheaper.\nMAN:                    Yes – you’d have saved 20% on your ticket today. So you paid the full price for your ticket?\nSOPHIE:               I paid £23.70. (Q5)\nMAN:                    OK. Do you think that’s good value for money?\nSOPHIE:               Not really. I think it’s too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.\nMAN:                    Yes, that’s one of the main complaints we get. So, you didn’t buy your ticket in advance?\nSOPHIE:               No. I know it’s cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn’t know I was coming then.\nMAN:                    I know. You can’t always plan ahead. So, did you buy it this morning?\nSOPHIE:               No, it was yesterday.\nMAN:                    Right. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?\nSOPHIE:               Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines. I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours. There’s always a queue for the machines and they’re often out of order.\nMAN:                    A lot of customers are saying the same thing.\nSOPHIE:               So to answer your question … I got an e-ticket online. (Q6)\n—————————-\nMAN:                    OK. Thank you. Now I’d like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey. So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?\nSOPHIE:               Well, I like the wifi on the train. It’s improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.\nMAN:                    That’s the first time today anyone’s mentioned that. It’s good to get some positive feedback on that.\nSOPHIE:               Mmm.\nMAN:                    And, is there anything you weren’t satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:               Well, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable but today there was a delay (Q7); the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.\nMAN:                    OK. I’ll put that down. Now I’d also like to ask about the facilities at this station. You’ve probably noticed that the whole station’s been upgraded. What are you most satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:               I think the best thing is that they’ve improved the amount of information (Q8) about train times etc. that’s given to passengers – it’s much clearer – before there was only one board and I couldn’t always see it properly – which was frustrating.\nMAN:                    That’s good. And is there anything you’re not satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:               Let’s see … I think things have generally improved a lot. The trains are much more modern and I like the new café. But one thing is that there aren’t enough places to sit down, especially on the platforms. (Q9)\nMAN:                    OK – so I’ll put ‘seating’ down, shall I, as the thing you’re least satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:               Yes, OK.\nMAN:                    Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities? We’d like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.\nSOPHIE:               OK.\nMAN:                    What about the parking (Q10) at the station?\nSOPHIE:               Well to be honest, I don’t really have an opinion as I never use it.\nMAN:                    So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.\nSOPHIE:               Yes, I suppose so …\nMAN:                    OK, and what about …?\nPART 2\nAs chair of the town council subcommittee on park facilities, I’d like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park. So if you could just take a look at the map I handed out, let’s begin with a general overview. So the basic arrangement of the park hasn’t changed – it still has two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.\nThe café continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks and is still in the same place, looking out over the lake and next to the old museum. (Q11)\nWe’re hoping to change the location of the toilets, and bring them nearer to the centre of the park as they’re a bit out of the way at present, near the adventure playground, in the corner of your map. (Q12)\nThe formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two. They used to be behind the old museum, but we’re now used the space near the south gate – between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum. (Q13)\nWe have a new outdoor gym for adults and children, which is already proving very popular. It’s by the glass houses, just to the right of the path from the south gate. You have to look for it as it’s a bit hidden in the trees. (Q14)\nOne very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp. It’s in constant use during the evenings and holidays. It’s near the old museum, at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum. (Q15)\nWe’ve also introduced a new area for wild flowers, to attract bees and butterflies. It’s on a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake, just south of the adventure playground. (Q16)\n———————–\nNow let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.\nOne of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground. We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam, and decided to use our available funds to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park. It’s open year-round, though it close early in the winter months, and entrance is completely free (Q17/Q18). Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age, but we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there (Q17/Q18). There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.\nLastly, the glass houses. A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side (Q19/Q20). Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports, as well as the plants that had been destroyed, although unfortunately the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now. At present the glass houses are open from 10am to 3pm Mondays to Thursdays, and it’s hoped to extend this to the weekend soon (Q19/Q20). We’re grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.\nThe gardens have …\nPART 3\nANNIE:  OK, Jack. Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration, let’s discuss what we’ve discovered so far.\nJACK:     Fine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven’t done much research yet.\nANNIE:  Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I’d been some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse. But I didn’t realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn’t melt for months (Q21). The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too.\nJACK:     I didn’t know that.\nANNIE:  Yes, pits were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains – even though they were at quite a distance. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it. Both the ice and the snow were then sold (Q22). The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.\nJACK:     I wouldn’t be surprised. I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges. Several different technologies are used, but they were too complex for me to understand.\nANNIE:  You have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.\nJACK:     You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?\nANNIE:  Exactly. At least these are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safety, but of course some people just dump old fridges in the countryside. (Q23)\nJACK:     It’s hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately (Q23). In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!\nANNIE:  That sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.\nJACK:     That’s right. In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average, and a lot last for 20 or more. So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge, they’re not expensive, compared with some household appliances. (Q24)\nANNIE:  True. I suppose manufactures encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs. I’m sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!\nJACK:     Yes, there’s been quite a change.\n———————–\nJACK:     Right, let’s make a list of topics to cover in our presentation, and decide who’s going to do more research on them. Then later, we can get together and plan the next step.\nANNIE:  OK. How about starting with how useful refrigeration is, and the range of goods that are refrigerated (Q25) nowadays? Because of course it’s not just food and drinks.\nJACK:     No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.\nANNIE:  And computers. I could do that (Q26), unless you particularly want to.\nJACK:     No, that’s fine by me. What about the effects of refrigeration on people’s health (Q26)? After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been lots of benefits too, like always have access to fresh food. Do you fancy dealing with that?\nANNIE:  I’m no terribly keen, to be honest.\nJACK:     Nor me. My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.\nANNIE:  Oh, all right then, I’ll do you a favour (Q27). But you own me, Jack.\nWhat about the effects on food producers, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries? Something for you, maybe?\nJACK:     I don’t mind. It should be quite interesting.\nANNIE:  I think we should also look at how refrigeration has helped whole cities (Q28) – like Las Vegas, which couldn’t exist without refrigeration because it’s in the middle of a desert.\nJACK:     Right. I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that’s got a chapter about this sort of thing. I could give you the title, if you want to do this section.\nANNIE:  Not particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.\nJACK:     OK, leave it to me, then.\nANNIE:  Thanks. Then there’s transport, and the difference that refrigerated trucks (Q29) have made. I wouldn’t mind having a go at that.\nJACK:     Don’t forget trains, too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.\nANNIE:  I hadn’t thought of trains. Thanks.\nJACK:     Shall we have a separate section on domestic fridges (Q30)? After all, they’re something everyone’s familiar with.\nANNIE:  What about splitting it into two? You could investigate 19th- and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll concentrate on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.\nJACK:     OK, that’d suit me.\nPART 4\nHi everyone, in this session I’ll be presenting my research about the social history of Britain during the Industrial Revolution. I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon; consumerism – where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people’s lives.\nIn fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people’s possessions was used as an indication of the wealth (Q31) of the country. Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions, but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution. This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in technology (Q32) triggered massive social changes that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.\nFirst let’s look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal. And it’s true that the Industrial Revolution couldn’t have taken place at all if it weren’t for these new sources of power (Q33). They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills that had dominated before this. The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was textiles (Q34). This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone.\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops, often in their own homes. But enormous new machines (Q35) were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work. In fact, large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.\n———————–\nAs well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century, which carried very few people and good, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed. These were particularly important for the transportation of goods. The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed, becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren’t just coal, iron, clothes, and so on – significantly, they included newspapers (Q36), which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country, but could also read about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. so faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient – goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the local (Q37) market.\nThe third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing. The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores – a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved lighting (Q38) inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which made it possible for windows (Q39) to be much larger than previously. New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods; now there was an explosion in advertising (Q40) trying to persuade people to go shopping.\nFlanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice. All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries – from sugar to cutlery – became conveniences, and before long they’d turned into necessities: life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable. Rather like mobile phones these days!"},"IELTS/BTVN":{"slug":"IELTS/BTVN","filePath":"IELTS/BTVN.md","title":"BTVN","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Tuần 5\nOne terrible natural disaster I know is a big flood that happened in Central Vietnam a few years ago. It rained heavily for many days and the rivers became very high. Many houses were under water and people had to move to schools or safe places. Some people lost their animals and farms. The government and volunteers came to help with food and clothes. I saw many pictures on the news, and I felt very sad for the local people. They had to start everything again after the flood. I think floods are very dangerous and we should protect the environment to reduce them.\n\nOne natural disaster that I remember clearly is the severe flood in Central Vietnam in 2020. Heavy rain lasted for almost a week, causing rivers to overflow and destroy many villages. Thousands of houses were submerged, and people lost their belongings, crops, and even animals. Many roads were blocked, which made it hard for rescue teams to reach the affected areas.\nI watched the news every day, and the images were heartbreaking. I felt sorry for the people who suffered, especially children and the elderly. Luckily, many volunteers and soldiers came to provide food, water, and clothes. After the flood, people worked together to rebuild their homes.\nThis disaster reminded me of how important it is to protect nature and to have good plans for disaster prevention. It also showed the strong spirit and kindness of Vietnamese people.\n\ndestroy many villages: tàn phá nhiều ngôi làng\n\n\nOne unforgettable natural disaster that I witnessed through the media was the massive flood that struck Central Vietnam in late 2020. It was caused by continuous heavy rain and tropical storms over several days, which made rivers overflow and inundate a vast area. Entire villages were underwater; houses, schools, and roads were badly damaged, and many families lost their property and livestock. \nWhat impressed me most was how quickly people came together to help. Volunteers from different parts of the country donated food, medicine, and money to support the victims. Rescue workers risked their lives to reach isolated areas. Although the scene was tragic, it also showed the compassion and solidarity of Vietnamese people during difficult times. \nPersonally, I felt both heartbroken and inspired. It made me realize how powerful nature can be, and how small humans are compared to it. Since then, I’ve become more aware of environmental protection and disaster preparedness.\n\nnatural disaster thảm hỏa thiên nhiên\n➡️ Vocabulary &amp; grammar: simple past, limited linking words, basic vocabulary.\n➡️ Band estimate: 5.0\n\nTuần 4\nI want to talk about Ho Chi Minh City. It is the biggest city in Vietnam and it is in the south of the country. The city is very crowded and noisy because there are many people and a lot of motorbikes on the streets. When I went there, I visited Ben Thanh Market, where I could buy clothes and souvenirs. I also tried some delicious food, like noodles and sandwiches. The tall buildings in the center looked very modern and exciting.\nI like this city because it is busy and there are many things to do. Young people can go shopping, watch movies, or meet friends in coffee shops. However, I think sometimes life there is difficult. The traffic is always terrible, and the air is not clean. Even though I enjoyed my trip, I feel living there every day would be a little stressful.\n\nI’d like to describe Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam and located in the north of the country. Hanoi is very well-known for its rich culture, historical buildings, and traditional food. The Old Quarter is one of the most popular areas where visitors can walk through small streets and discover many local shops. It is also famous for dishes such as “pho” and “bun cha,” which are considered specialties of the city.\nFor young people, Hanoi provides a mix of modern lifestyle and cultural experiences. You can go to shopping malls, cinemas, and cafés, or you can explore historical landmarks like the Temple of Literature or Hoan Kiem Lake. Personally, I enjoy the city because it has both a traditional charm and modern development. However, I must admit that it has problems, especially with traffic congestion and air pollution. These issues sometimes make daily life uncomfortable, but overall Hanoi is still an attractive and lively place to live.\n\nThe city I would like to talk about is Singapore, which left a strong impression on me when I visited it two years ago. Although Singapore is a small island nation in Southeast Asia, it is one of the most modern and well-organized cities I have ever seen.\nOne of the first things that amazed me was its cleanliness and safety. The streets are spotless, and the rules are very strict, which creates a very disciplined lifestyle. Another remarkable aspect is the public transport system. Trains and buses are always punctual, comfortable, and affordable, so travelling around the city is extremely convenient.\nSingapore also offers a wide range of attractions. For example, I had a chance to see Marina Bay Sands, which is an iconic hotel with an infinity pool on top. I also enjoyed Gardens by the Bay, a futuristic park with giant tree-like structures that light up at night. Moreover, Singapore is multicultural, so I could explore different cuisines in places like Chinatown, Little India, and Arab Street.\nWhat I admire most is that Singapore successfully balances rapid economic development with environmental protection. Green spaces are everywhere, and the government pays attention to sustainability. Although the cost of living is relatively high, I think the quality of life there is absolutely worth it. For me, it is a dream city to live in.\nĐọc\nWhy ‘Think Outside the Box’ Is Bad Advice\nRaise your hand if you’ve ever been in a brainstorming meeting, and you’ve heard someone (usually the boss) say that everyone needs to ‘think outside the box!’ This advice is normally met with nods, yeses, and other signs of approval. And that’s because it seems to make so much sense. If you’re trying to come up with something truly innovative, then of course you shouldn’t be thinking about the problem the same way as everyone else. If you do, you’ll just end up with the same product or service as the competition. And no one wants to be a copycat when they’re trying to be innovative.\nRecently this exact brainstorming scenario happened to me - even the part where I found myself nodding in approval. But the more I thought about it, the more confused I got. What exactly does this phrase ‘think outside the box’ mean? And is it actually good advice? In order to figure out this out, let’s first talk about what this phrase even means.\n‍Removing the Ambiguity\nThe phrase “think outside the box” is confusing because it’s ambiguous. What exactly is ‘the box’? Sometimes this phrase is thrown out there to imply that our final product, service, or solution needs to be different than what already exists. This isn’t bad advice necessarily, but it’s just not actionable. The phrase isn’t clear in telling us what to do. More often than not, this advice is given when a team gets stuck thinking about the practical sides of a problem. The person telling the team to “think outside the box” is trying to get the team to stop thinking about the practical constraints or boundaries of the problem. People often think that these constraints constrain their creativity. They’ll say things like ‘well if we just didn’t have to think about all these real-world factors, then our design would be awesome! It would really allow us to think outside the box.’ With this new lens for looking at the phrase, my initial question about whether or not this is good or bad advice can be stated more clearly as:\nWhen we’re trying to come up with an innovative solution, is it better to think about the boundaries of the problem or should we just ignore them and “think freely”?\nEmbrace the Boundaries\nWhile it might seem like letting our minds wander freely is the best way for us to be creative, we’re here to tell you that this isn’t true. There are three reasons why it’s better to think about the boundaries of your problem as opposed to simply ignoring them in order to ‘think outside the box.’\nOff to the Races\nThe first reason boundaries supercharge creativity is because they mitigate the ‘paradox of choice’. This phrase was coined by Barry Schwartz in his book appropriately entitled The Paradox of Choice: Why Less Is More. In it, he argues that today’s world is full of too many options to the point that we are all overwhelmed trying to find the perfect choice and thus less happy as a society. The key takeaway for us here is that it’s really hard to choose between a lot of options. So when we’re innovating without boundaries, the possibilities — and the choices — are endless. We literally have too many choices to fathom. This can be overwhelming and lead to a creativity block. We can find ourselves stressing about our inability to think through everything. When this happens we shut down. With established boundaries, though, the potential starting points for our ideas are much clearer.\nPicking the Best\nThe second reason boundaries supercharge creativity speaks to the other half of Barry Schwartz’s ‘paradox of choice’ argument. Not only are people paralyzed by too many choices, but they actually make awful decisions when they’re overloaded with options. No matter how skilled you might think you are at sifting through countless options, study after study has shown that the decision-making capacity of your brain works kind of like a bank. The more power you withdraw for one decision, the less you have to put toward the next. Neuroscientists refer to this as “psychological depletion.” And researchers have found that when people try to make decisions when they are already psychologically depleted, they’ll actually end up making really awful ones. They’ll choose worse places to live, do worse on basic math problems, and more!\nOptimize Your Time\nThe final way boundaries supercharge your creative process is by helping to focus your time on areas where you can have the biggest impact. All of us have spent enough time solving problems to know that they don’t come with a perfect turn-by-turn roadmap for how to solve them. This doesn’t mean that there isn’t an overall process that we can follow, it just means that every problem is different and comes with a whole slew of different paths that you could take to solve that problem. With so many possible paths, we have to make sure that we’re spending our time wisely. One way to do that is by focusing on the boundaries. Because without boundaries, you could pursue an idea for months that never had a shot at being implemented. Not only would that be a huge waste, but it would leave you with very little if any, time to work on an idea that is within the bounds of what’s possible.\nBe Careful of the Advice to ‘Think Outside the Box’\nTaken together, these three superpowers of boundaries help take your creativity to the next level. By reducing choice, you’ve given yourself a clear realm within which to start your brainstorming, rather than an intimidating vast blank canvas. Boundaries also give you the opportunity to evaluate all of the viable directions rather than leave you guessing about which might be the best path to pursue. Finally, boundaries focus your creative energies right where you want them: on ideas that can make a difference.\nSo the next time you hear someone tell you to ‘think outside the box’ instead of nodding your head, take the opportunity to make sure everyone’s on the same page about the boundaries of the problem. Despite common wisdom to the contrary, focusing on these boundaries will actually help us be more innovative.\nĐọc trả lời câu hỏi\nThe big growth in people and cities is causing some big issues in many places. To deal with these problems, some governments are saying businesses should move to the countryside. While this strategy may offer certain benefits, it also brings about drawbacks that, in my opinion, outweigh the advantages.\nOn the one hand, the relocation of businesses to rural areas can bring several merits. First, it can make life in big cities easier by taking off some of the pressure on things like housing and transportation. With fewer businesses and workers in cities, there could be fewer cars on the roads, resulting in less commuting time and stress. Second, moving businesses to the countryside can make new jobs for local communities. These companies can create jobs in things like transportation and logistics, helping with problems like not having enough jobs in rural places.\nOn the other hand, there are notable disadvantages associated with relocating businesses to rural areas. First, businesses might find it hard to get workers with the right skills. In rural places, there are not as many people, so it’s not easy to find workers with the requisite skills and qualifications . This can make it hard for businesses to work well. Moreover, moving to rural places can make transportation and logistics more expensive. These areas are far from big transportation centers, and the roads might not be as good as in cities, which makes it harder and costlier to move products.\nIn conclusion, while there are certain advantages to relocating businesses to rural areas, I firmly believe that the disadvantages, particularly concerning increased costs and a potential shortage of skilled labor, outweigh these benefits.\n✍️ Exercise 1: Vocabulary – Fill in the blanks\nReplace the missing words using the provided list:\nWords: drawbacks – commuting – notable – requisite – merits – associated\nRelocating businesses to rural areas may offer certain merits, such as reducing pressure on cities.\nOne of the most notable disadvantages is the shortage of skilled labor.\nMoving away from cities is associated with higher transport costs.\nLonger commuting time is a major problem in big cities.\nMany rural workers lack the requisite skills to meet company demands.\nDespite some advantages, the drawbacks seem to outweigh the benefits.\n✍️ Exercise 2: Grammar – Correct the errors\nIdentify and correct the grammar/word choice mistakes:\nThe big growth in people and cities is causing some big issues in many places.\nSome governments are saying businesses should move to the countryside.\nWith fewer businesses and workers in cities, there could be fewer cars on the roads, resulting in less commuting time and stress.\nThis make them to less appreciate very high.

At the beginning, I wanted to help because my friend needed it. However, I was afraid that my friend might not pay me back. I also worried about our friendship. In the end, I decided to give a small amount of money and asked my friend to return it in a short time. But when the time came, my friend still did not pay me back. I felt disappointed and learned that lending money to friends can be very risk and we should be careful. Looking back, this challenge helped me grow as a person and taught me the value of trust in friendship.\nOne of the biggest challenges in my life was adapting to university life. At the beginning, I struggled with time management because I had to balance classes, assignments, and part-time work. Sometimes I stayed up late, which made me feel exhausted. (Complex sentence with because/which). Another problem was making new friends. I was quite shy, so I found it hard to talk to strangers. However, I decided to join some clubs and activities at school. Thanks to this, I met new people and improved my communication skills. (Linking: However, Thanks to this). Gradually, I learned how to organize my schedule better. Looking back, this challenge helped me grow as a person and taught me the value of patience and persistence. \n👉 Ngữ pháp &amp; từ vựng ăn điểm: \n\n\nComplex sentence: I struggled with time management because… \n\n\nCụm từ: adapting to university life, time management, make new friends, improve communication skills, persistence \n\n\n🎯 Band 7 – 200 từ \nA memorable challenge that I encountered was preparing for the IELTS exam. At first, I underestimated how demanding it could be. The listening section seemed fast, the reading passages were long, and writing essays within a time limit was stressful. (Advanced grammar: parallel structure). Moreover, I lacked confidence in speaking because I was afraid of making mistakes. To overcome these difficulties, I created a strict study plan. I divided my time wisely between the four skills, and I also practiced with online tests to track my progress. (High-level collocations: strict study plan, track my progress). Whenever I felt discouraged, I reminded myself of my long-term goal of studying abroad. Gradually, I noticed improvement, especially in writing and speaking. In the end, I achieved the score I needed. This experience taught me not only academic skills but also important life lessons, such as discipline, resilience, and self-motivation. \n👉 Ngữ pháp &amp; từ vựng ăn điểm: \n\n\nComplex &amp; advanced structures: Whenever I felt discouraged, I reminded myself… / not only … but also \n\n\nCụm từ: underestimate a challenge, within a time limit, overcome difficulties, strict study plan, long-term goal, resilience, self-motivation\n\n\n09062025\n🟢 Band 5 Sample (~100 từ) \nI want to talk about Arsene Wenger, he was a famous football manager from France.\nI known him as the manager of Arsenal Football Club in England.\nHe worked at Arsenal from 1996 to 2018.\nIn 2003-2004, his team played the whole season without losing a match.\nUntil now, no other team in England has been able to repeat this record.\nI like him because of his intelligence and his great vision.\nHe made a very big contribution to building the new stadium for the club.\nBecause of that, the club has grown strongly and sustainably.\nI want to talk about Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla.

He is the founder of Tesla, which produces electric cars, and SpaceX, a company that builds rockets. What I find impressive about him is his creativity and strong determination. He works extremely hard, often spending long hours in his office, which shows his dedication to his goals. \nI admire him not only because he is successful, but also because he tries to solve global problems such as climate changeand sustainable energy. For example, Tesla cars help reduce pollution, and SpaceX aims to make space travel possible for humans in the future.

Similarly, SpaceX has achieved milestones that were once thought impossible, such as reusing rockets and planning missions to Mars. \nI also respect him because he doesn’t only focus on making profit, but also on addressing global issues like climate change and sustainable energy.

While we were strolling along My Khe Beach at sunset, we noticed dozens of tourists playing volleyball and taking photos. Da Nang is a very clean and friendly city, and people are always willing to help strangers. I have visited several places in Vietnam, but Da Nang has impressed me the most so far. I will definitely return next year, and by then, I hope I will have discovered more hidden gems such as Ba Na Hills and the Marble Mountains.\nReading Daily\nCan you stay emotionally alive?\n\nModern life can make it hard to stay socially connected. Many people work online or live far from family. But even small efforts make a big difference to the brain. Regular^[Regular (a): (frequent) đều đặn] phone calls, sharing meals, or joining a local group can improve brain function and boost^[boost: (improve) tăng cường] mood. Technology can help, but face-to-face^[face-to-face (a): (in person) trực tiếp] contact is still the most powerful^[powerful (a): (strong) mạnh mẽ]. The lesson is simple: don’t wait until you feel lonely. Build social habits^[habits: (routines) thói quen] early. The brain, like a muscle, gets stronger with healthy use and connection is one of the best exercises^[exercises: (activities) bài tập] it can get.\nIs solitude Harming Your Brain?\n\n\nBeing alone for a short time can be relaxing. But extended isolation can harm your mental health^[mental health: sức khỏe tinh thần]. Without conversations or emotional support^[emotional support: (encouragement): hỗ trợ tinh thần], people often begin to feel anxious^[anxious: (nervous) lo lắng], sad, or unmotivated. The brain loses regular stimulation, which can lead to overthinking^[overthinking: (excessive thinking) suy nghĩ quá mức] or negative thoughts. Over time, this can increase the risk of depression or even cognitive decline^[cognitive decline: (mental weakening) suy giảm nhận thức]. In some cases, people may start to feel disconnected^[disconnected: (detached) tách biệt] from reality^[reality: (real world) thực tại]. The key lesson: staying mentally healthy means staying socially active, even in small ways like talking to a friend, joining a class, or volunteering^[volunteering: (helping freely) làm tình nguyện].\nWhat Happens Without Human Connection?\n\n\n\nHuman brains are  wired^[designed: kết nối tự nhiên] for connection. From birth, we depend on others^[others là đại từ (pronoun), thay thế cho other people/things khi không cần nhắc lại danh từ.] to survive^[survive: (stay alive) sống sót], learn, and grow. When we lack social contact for long periods, the brain starts to react as if we’re in danger. Studies show that loneliness^[loneliness: (isolation) sự cô đơn] activates^[activates: triggers] the same brain regions as physical pain^[the same + noun + as + noun/pronoun/clause → dùng để so sánh tính giống nhau giữa hai sự vật, sự việc.]. Without regular interaction, our stress levels rise, and parts of brain related to thinking and memory-like the hippocampus^[hippocampus: (memory area) hồi hải mã]-can shrink^[shrink: (get smaller) teo lại]. This affects focus, mood, and decision-making^[decision-making: (choosing) khả năng đưa ra quyết định]. The lesson here: just like we need food and sleep, we also need people. Social connection isn’t a luxury-it’s a basic^[basic: (essential) cơ bản] human need.\nTừ vựng\nDo\n\ndo research - làm nghiên cứu: Many students do research on social issues for their IELTS essays.

This is Amber – you said to phone^[you said to phone = you said (that I should) phone] if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned^[the job agency you mentioned = công ty môi giới việc làm mà bạn nhắc đến]. Is now a good time?\nWILLIAM:            Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside – they’re based in^[be based in: cách nói trang trọng hơn located in] Docklands – I can tell you the address now – 497 Eastside.\nAMBER:               OK, thanks. So is there anyone in particular^[anyone in particular → “một người nào đó cụ thể”] I should speak to there?\nWILLIAM:            The agent^[The agent who/that I always deal with] I always deal with^[deal with somebody = làm việc/giải quyết với ai đó] is called Becky Jamieson.\nAMBER:               Let me write that down – Becky …\nWILLIAM:            Jamieson (Q1) J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.\nAMBER:               Do you have her direct line^[số điện thoại trực tiếp]?\nWILLIAM:            Yes, it’s in my contacts somewhere – right, here we are: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I wouldn’t call her until the afternoon if I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s really helpful and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth^[it would be worth: Cấu trúc mang nghĩa đáng để làm gì] getting in touch with her^[getting in touch with her: Cụm động từ, có nghĩa là liên lạc với cô ấy hoặc kết nối với cô ấy] for an informal chat^[an informal chat: một cuộc trò chuyện thân mật].\nAMBER:               It’s mainly clerical and admin jobs^[clerical and admin jobs: công việc hành chính văn phòng] they deal with, isn’t it?\nWILLIAM:            That’s right. I know you’re hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually – but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff^[temporary staff: nhân viên tạm thời] for the finance sector^[finance sector: nghành tài chính] – which will look good on your CV – and generally pays better too.\nAMBER:               Yeah – I’m just a bit worried because I don’t have much office experience.\nWILLIAM:            I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist^[receptionist: nhân viên lễ tân], or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s communication that really matters – so you’d be fine there. And you’ll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It’s not that complicated.\nAMBER:               OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.\nWILLIAM:            That shouldn’t be too difficult. But you’re more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended. It’s unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.\nAMBER:               Right, I’ve heard the pay isn’t too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.\nWILLIAM:            Oh yes – definitely. The hourly rate is about £10, 11 if you’re lucky.\nAMBER:               That’s pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.\n————————————————\nWILLIAM:            Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?\nAMBER:               Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview.\nWILLIAM:            The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance^[about a week in advance (trước khoảng một tuần)].\nAMBER:               I suppose I should dress smartly if it’s for office work – I can probably borrow a suit from Mum.\nWILLIAM:            Good idea. It’s better to look too smart than too casual.\nAMBER:               Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?\nWILLIAM:            No – they don’t need to see those, I don’t think.\nAMBER:               What about my passport?\nWILLIAM:            Oh yes – they will ask to see that.\nAMBER:               OK.\nWILLIAM:            I wouldn’t get stressed about the interview though. It’s just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you’ll like. So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates – fairly basic ones. And they probably won’t ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.\nAMBER:               Hope not.\nWILLIAM:            Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview will be useful because they’ll give you feedback on your performance so you can improve next time.\nAMBER:               And they’ll have access to jobs which aren’t advertised.\nWILLIAM:            Exactly – most temporary jobs aren’t advertised.\nAMBER:               And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time – it’s much easier than ringing up individual companies.\nWILLIAM:            Yes indeed. Well I think …\nTEST 2\nPART 1\nTIM:       Good morning. You’re through to^[“be through to” (khi gọi điện thoại) = bạn đã được kết nối với …] the tourist information office, Tim speaking. How can I help you?\nJEAN:     Oh hello. Could you give me some information about next month’s festival, please? My family and I will be staying in the town that week.\nTIM:       Of course. Well it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.\nJEAN:     Oh I heard about that. The orchestra and singers^[The orchestra and singers = dàn nhạc và ca sĩ] come from the USA, don’t they?\nTIM:       They’re from Canada. They’re very popular over there. They’re going to perform a number of well-known pieces^[well-known pieces = những tác phẩm nổi tiếng] that will appeal to children as well as adults.\nJEAN:     That sounds good. My whole family^[My whole family = cả gia đình tôi] are interested in music.\nTIM:       The next day, the 18th, there’s a performance by a ballet company called Eustatis.\nJEAN:     Sorry?\nTIM:       The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S. They appeared in last year’s festival, and went down very well^[went down very well = được đón nhận (tốt/xấu) bởi khán giả/người nghe]. Again, their programme^[programme = program] is designed for all ages.\nJEAN:     Good. I expect we’ll go to that. I hope there’s going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.\nTIM:       You’re in luck! On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group^[a local amateur group = một nhóm nghiệp dư địa phương] are performing one written by a member of group. It’s called Jemima. That’ll be on in the town hall^[in the town hall = ở tòa thị chính]. They’ve already performed it two or three times. I haven’t seen it myself, but the review in the local paper^[in the local paper = trên tờ báo địa phương] was very good.\nJEAN:     And is it suitable for children?\nTIM:       Yes, in fact it’s aimed more at children than at adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.\nJEAN:     And what about dance? Will there be any performances?\nTIM:       Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces, with electronic music by young composers.\nJEAN:     Uh-huh.\nTIM:       The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other, so it’s got^[it’s got = (cách nói thân mật, Anh-Anh) = it has] the rather strange name^[the rather strange name = cái tên khá lạ], Chat.\nJEAN:     I suppose that’s because that’s something we do both face to face and online.\nTIM:       That’s right.\n———————-\nTIM:       Now there are also some workshops and other activities. They’ll all take place at least once every day, so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.\nJEAN:     Good. We’re particularly interested in cookery – you don’t happen to have^[Happen to V = làm một việc gì đó một cách hoàn toàn tình cờ, không tính trước] a cookery workshop, do you?\nTIM:       We certainly do. It’s going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle, and it’ll show that even sweet things like cakes^[even sweet things like cakes → ngay cả những món ngọt như bánh] can contain much less sugar than they usually do.\nJEAN:     That might be worth going^[be worth doing sth → cấu trúc: đáng để làm gì] to. We’re trying to encourage our children to cook.\nTIM:       Another workshop is just for children, and that’s on creating posters to reflect the history of the town. The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives have changed over the centuries. The results will be exhibited in the community centre. Then the other workshop is in toy-making, and that’s for adults only.\nJEAN:     Oh, why’s that?\nTIM:       Because it involves carpentry – participants will be making toys out of wood, so there’ll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.\nJEAN:     It makes sense to keep children away from it.\nTIM:       Exactly. Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities. There’ll be supervised wild swimming …\nJEAN:     Wild swimming? What’s that?\nTIM:       It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.\nJEAN:     Oh OK. In a lake, for instance.\nTIM:       Yes, there’s a beautiful one just outside the town^[just outside the town → ngay bên ngoài thị trấn], and that’ll be the venue for the swimming. There’ll be lifeguards on duty, so it’s suitable for all ages. And finally, there’ll be a walk in some nearby woods every day. The leader is an expert on insects. He’ll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment. So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.\nJEAN:     There certainly are.\nTIM:       If you’d like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going, the festival organizer is keeping a blog. Just search online for the festival website, and you’ll find it.\nJEAN:     Well, thank you very much for all the information.\nTIM:       You’re welcome.

Unlike traditional tourism, which often focuses on luxury hotels, shopping, and entertainment, eco-tourism aims to promote responsible travel to natural areas. Its main goals are to conserve the environment, respect local cultures, and provide benefits to local communities.\nEco-tourists usually travel to places such as rainforests, mountains, or coastal areas that are rich in biodiversity. For example, Costa Rica has become a popular destination because of its national parks and wildlife reserves. Visitors there can see rare species like the quetzal bird or explore active volcanoes, while learning how conservation projects protect endangered animals.\nOne of the advantages of eco-tourism is that it creates income for local people. Instead of working in large hotels or resorts owned by foreign companies, locals can earn money by offering homestays, guiding tours, or selling handmade crafts. This helps them preserve their traditional way of life and reduces the negative impact of mass tourism.\nHowever, eco-tourism is not without problems. In some cases, too many tourists visit fragile environments, which can damage the very areas that should be protected. For instance, trekking in the Himalayas has caused pollution and waste problems in remote villages. Therefore, eco-tourism needs to be carefully managed in order to truly achieve sustainability.\n❓ Questions\n1–4: True / False / Not Given\nEco-tourism mainly focuses on shopping and entertainment.  F\nCosta Rica is famous for both volcanoes and wildlife. (T)\nEco-tourism always protects the environment perfectly.  T\nTrekking in the Himalayas has created waste problems.  T\n5–7: Multiple Choice\n5. The main purpose of eco-tourism is to:\nA. build luxury hotels\nB. promote responsible travel\nC. replace mass tourism completely\nD. make travel cheaper V\nOne advantage of eco-tourism is that locals can:\nA. travel abroad for work\nB. earn money through guiding and homestays V\nC. stop working entirely\nD. move to big cities\nThe writer suggests eco-tourism should be:\nA. banned in fragile areas\nB. managed carefully\nC. replaced by traditional tourism\nD. free for local people\n8–10: Matching (Choose from A–D)\nMatch the countries/places with the information:\nA. Costa Rica\nB. The Himalayas\nC. Traditional tourism\nD. Eco-tourism\nCauses pollution in remote villages → ____\nOffers shopping and entertainment → ____\nProtects biodiversity and local cultures → ____\nThe importance of learning a second language In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to speak more than one language has become a valuable skill. Learning a second language not only enhances communication but also opens doors to personal, cultural, and professional opportunities. One of the most significant benefits is improved career prospects. Many global companies seek employees who can communicate with international partners and clients. For instance, proficiency in Mandarin can be a competitive advantage for those working in trade and business with China. This skill can lead to higher salaries and greater job mobility. Moreover, acquiring a second language deepens cultural understanding. Language is closely tied to traditions, values, and ways of thinking. By learning another language, individuals gain insight into different worldviews, which fosters empathy and reduces cultural prejudice. For example, mastering French can help learners better appreciate French literature, films, and cuisine. From a cognitive perspective, research shows that bilingualism can boost brain function. It improves memory, multitasking, and problem-solving skills, while also delaying age-related cognitive decline. In this sense, language learning is not only a tool for communication but also an exercise for mental agility. However, mastering another language requires time, patience, and consistent practice. With the help of modern technology—such as language learning apps, online tutors, and immersive media—this process has become more accessible than ever. In conclusion, learning a second language is no longer optional; it is an essential skill in today’s globalised society. It enriches cultural awareness, sharpens the mind, and enhances professional opportunities, making it a worthwhile investment for people of all ages."},"IELTS/English":{"slug":"IELTS/English","filePath":"IELTS/English.md","title":"English","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"LỘ TRÌNH HỌC IELTS CHO NGƯỜI MẤT GỐC\n🗺️ LỘ TRÌNH HỌC IELTS CHO NGƯỜI MẤT GỐC – FULLTIME (12 THÁNG)\n🔹 Giai đoạn 1 (0–2 tháng): Phục hồi nền tảng – Target A2–B1 (Band 3.5–4.0)\n🔑 Tập trung Nghe, Đọc đơn giản – Phát âm – Từ vựng – Ngữ pháp cơ bản.\n• 📘 Ngữ pháp nền tảng: Thì cơ bản, câu điều kiện, so sánh, mệnh đề quan hệ,…\n• 🔊 Phát âm: IPA, nối âm, trọng âm câu.\n• 🧠 Từ vựng chủ đề: Family, Hobbies, School, Food, Travel,… (300–500 từ đầu tiên)\n• 🎧 Nghe: VoiceTube, Spotlight English, hoặc Listening Band 3–4.\n• 🗣️ Speaking: học câu đơn – trả lời part 1 đơn giản theo mẫu.\n• ✍️ Viết: 5 dạng câu ngữ pháp, viết đoạn văn đơn giản.\n📅 Học 4–5 tiếng/ngày → Em sẽ tạo nền rất nhanh!\n⸻\n🔹 Giai đoạn 2 (3–6 tháng): Vào Pre-IELTS – Target Band 5.0\n• 📚 Học 4 kỹ năng theo đề thi thật (Writing Task 1, 2; Speaking Part 1, 2; Reading/Listening dễ)\n• 💡 Học cách phân tích bài – idea generation\n• 📑 Học 600–800 từ theo chủ đề IELTS thông dụng (Technology, Environment, Education,…)\n• 🎯 Viết được đoạn văn Task 2 có cấu trúc\n• 🎤 Nói được 1 phút ở Speaking Part 2 với ý cơ bản\n• 🧪 Làm đề mỗi tuần 1 bài mini-test → kiểm tra kỹ năng\n⸻\n🔹 Giai đoạn 3 (7–12 tháng): IELTS Intensive – Target Band 6.5–7.0\n• 🧱 Nâng Writing Task 2 lên 250–280 từ: idea sâu hơn, collocation tốt hơn\n• 🔁 Speaking luyện phản xạ – câu nối – sửa lỗi phát âm &amp; ngữ pháp\n• 📊 Reading speed tăng lên ~250 từ/phút → luyện paraphrasing\n• 🧠 Từ vựng nâng cao: idioms, phrasal verbs, formal vocab\n• 🎧 Listening Part 3, 4 – theo lộ trình Band 6.5–7.0\nLink\ndocs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mSPeiVkBxwq0t7kznREgL4Yf-CaC6m1H4WECMHmGhGM/edit\n#FFFFFF - Trắng (mặc định)\n#FF6E6E - Đỏ nhạt\n#FFA500 - Cam sáng\n#00FFFF - Hiện tại đơn\n#FFD700 - Vàng tươi\n#1E90FF - Xanh dương sáng\n#ADFF2F - Quá khứ đơn\n#FF69B4 - Hiện tại hoàn thành\n#FF4500 - Tương lai đơn\n#B0C4DE - Xanh ghi nhạt"},"IELTS/Exercises":{"slug":"IELTS/Exercises","filePath":"IELTS/Exercises.md","title":"Exercises","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"251021\n2.

And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours? From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?\nANDREA:             No, I read about you in the newspaper. (Q2)\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone. What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?\nANDREA:             I’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one begins in Los Angeles and there’s plenty of time to visit some of the theme (Q3) parks there.\nANDREA:             That’s something on my children’s list so I’d want to include that.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.\nANDREA:             I don’t like the idea of staying in a tent (Q4). It’d be too hot.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.\nANDREA:             OK.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   The other trip we can arrange is slightly different. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria.\nANDREA:             Someone told me there’s a really nice castle (Q5) near Cambria. Will we go near that?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.\nANDREA:             Good. I’d like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.\nANDREA:             We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK. Well you could go straight on to San Diego.\nANDREA:             That’s good for beaches isn’t it? (Q6)\nTRAVEL AGENT:   That’s right, that’s a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.\nANDREA:             I don’t think so. We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.\n—————————–\nANDREA:             So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers 2,020 (Q7) kilometres. The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres. The cost is £525 per person. That includes accommodation, car rental and a flight (Q8) but no meals.\nANDREA:             OK. And the other trip?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.\nANDREA:             So is that cheaper then?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s £429 (Q9) per person, which is a good deal.\nANDREA:             So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   They aren’t included. But these hotels offer dinner (Q10) in the price.\nANDREA:             OK. Well, thank you very much. I’ll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.\nANDREA:             Goodbye.\nSECTION 2\nOn behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club I’ll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.\nOur greatest asset is probably our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn’t Olympic-sized, but now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s much wider (Q11&amp;Q12). This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.\nOur recently refurbished fitness suite (Q11&amp;Q12) has all the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from trampolining to yoga.\n——————–\nOne thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems (Q13). One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you.\nThe trainer will then take you through the safety rules (Q14) for using the equipment in the fitness suite. During your next exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It’s very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries. There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!\nAt the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period (Q15). This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.\nNow, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of £90 (Q16) in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP Clubs (Q17). There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot will be a great advantage. Individual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.\nPremier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times (Q18). This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members. Premier membership is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for guests every month (Q19). The monthly fee is £65.\nYou don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms, but it’s very important to remember your photo card (Q20) because you won’t be able to get in without it.\nFor people who aren’t working during the day then …\nSECTION 3\nJOHN:                   Erm … hello Professor, I’m John Wishart. I’m working on my entry for the Global Design Competition. My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.\nPROFESSOR:       Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it?\nJOHN:                   Well, it’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance. (Q21)\nPROFESSOR:       I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?\nJOHN:                   Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.\nPROFESSOR:       I see, that sounds tricky. And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?\nJOHN:                   Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different. (Q22)\nPROFESSOR:       That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?\nJOHN:                   Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.\nPROFESSOR:       And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?\nJOHN:                   Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone. (Q23)\nPROFESSOR:       So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.\nJOHN:                   That’s right.\nPROFESSOR:       It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?\nJOHN:                   Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.\nPROFESSOR:       In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?\nJOHN:                   The idea is to pressurize the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.\nPROFESSOR:       Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens once the dishes are clean?\nJOHN:                   Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas (Q24). Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system.\nPROFESSOR:       It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope.\nJOHN:                   Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again. (Q25)\nPROFESSOR:       What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?\nJOHN:                   Probably not, but that’s OK.\nPROFESSOR:       Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.\n——————————-\nPROFESSOR:       Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?\nJOHN:                   Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time. I have to give a presentation, and that’s the part I was hoping you could help me with. (Q26)\nPROFESSOR:       Right, well that should be easy enough. What have you managed to do so far?\nJOHN:                   Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.\nPROFESSOR:       I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a model of the machine. (Q27)\nJOHN:                   Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.\nPROFESSOR:       What is the main difficulty so far? Let me guess – is it the materials?\nJOHN:                   Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive. (Q28)\nPROFESSOR:       Look, projects like this are very important to us. They really help lift our profile. So why don’t you talk to the university about a grant? (Q29) I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.\nJOHN:                   That would be a great.\nPROFESSOR:       You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well. For a global competition such as this you need to make sure the technical details you’ve given are accurate and thorough. (Q30)\nJOHN:                   That would be a great help.\nPROFESSOR:       Is there anything else I can do?\nJOHN:                   Well, I’m really …\nSECTION 4\nToday we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family. One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few (Q31). Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power (Q32). Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. (Q33)\nThe white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams (Q34). Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.\nToday, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands (Q35). There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment – in other words, their ecosystem.\n———————–\nThe greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost (Q36). The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. (Q37)\nall these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low. (Q38)\nAnd so, what’s the situation going forward? Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem. The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method (Q39), which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.\nOther steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion (Q40). The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes …\nTest 02\nSECTION 1\nINTERVIEWER:   Excuse me.\nLUISA:                  Yes?\nINTERVIEWER:   I wonder if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport. It won’t take long.\nLUISA:                  No, that’s fine.\nINTERVIEWER:   Lovely. The survey is on behalf of the local council. They’d like to know about what transport you use any suggestions for improvement. Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today?\nLUISA:                  Sure. I came on the bus. (Example)\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself?\nLUISA:                  OK.\nINTERVIEWER:   What’s your name?\nLUISA:                  It’s Luisa …\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes.\nLUISA:                  Hardie. (Q1)\nINTERVIEWER:   Can you spell that, please?\nLUISA:                  Yes, it’s H-A-R-D-I-E.\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. Thanks. And can I have your address?\nLUISA:                  It’s 19 (Q2), White Stone Road.\nINTERVIEWER:   Oh, right. I know that area. It’s Bradfield, isn’t it?\nLUISA:                  That’s right.\nINTERVIEWER:   Is the postcode GT7?\nLUISA:                  It’s actually G-T-8, 2-L-C. (Q3)\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. And could I ask what your job is? Are you a student?\nLUISA:                  I’ve actually just finished my training. I’m a hairdresser. (Q4)\nINTERVIEWER:   Oh, right. And one more question in this section. What is the reason for you coming into town today?\nLUISA:                  Actually it’s not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason, but to see the dentist. (Q5)\nINTERVIEWER:   Right. Thanks.\n—————————-                   \nINTERVIEWER:   Now in this last section I’d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for getting to and from work, er, any suggestions you have for improvements.\nLUISA:                  Well, something I’ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift, I think the lighting should be better. (Q6)\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes, good point.\nLUISA:                  And of course, I think it’s a real shame they’ve been cutting down on the number of footpaths. They should have more of those. Then people would walk more.\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes, right.\nLUISA:                  And, I don’t think there are enough trains. That’s why I don’t use them – you have to wait so long. (Q7)\nINTERVIEWER:   Thanks. And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling. As you may know, there’s a drive in the city to get more people to cycle to work.\nLUISA:                  Right.\nINTERVIEWER:   But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to cycle to work.\nLUISA:                  Yep. Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes. (Q8)\nINTERVIEWER:   OK.\nLUISA:                  And also, I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I’d need a shower somewhere at work. (Q9)\nINTERVIEWER:   Right.\nLUISA:                  And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn’t be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads. I think I’d like to see you offering training for that (Q10), you know. I’d feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.\nINTERVIEWER:   Well, that’s very helpful. Thank you very much for your time.\nLUISA:                  No problem. Bye.\nSECTION 2\nGood morning. I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public (Q11), in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC – the South West Regional Development Commission.\nFirst of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits is so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system – the only one of its kind in the world – which enables seawater to be used in the pool. (Q12)\nNow, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract (Q13), but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s.\nWe hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have. (Q14)\n————————\nAnd now, moving on the Central Park Playground, which we’re pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for safety: the news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into sex areas showing different parts of the world – each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on – fauna native to the forests of the region (Q15). Moving south to the Antarctic – we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains (Q16) – I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America – and here the theme is El Dorado – games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones (Q17). And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate – I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the international Space Station (Q18). Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other fortifications (Q19). Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent. (Q20)\nNow, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we’d love to see you there – so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.\nSECTION 3\nVICTOR:               Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl?\nOLIVIA:                Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things. (Q21&amp;Q22)\nVICTOR:               That’s right, he had his own the little museum. And I think it’s unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies; I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example.\nOLIVIA:                Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think …\nVICTOR:               No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man. (Q21&amp;Q22)\nOLIVIA:                Oh, right … After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a small island, to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people’s lifestyles. (Q23&amp;Q24)\nVICTOR:               As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut of by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do.\nOLIVIA:                An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that.                          \nVICTOR:               OK.\n————————-\nOLIVIA:                All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration: Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.\nVICTOR:               Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land. (Q25)\nOLIVIA:                Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes.               \nVICTOR:               Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake – sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia?\nOLIVIA:                Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. (Q26)                     \nVICTOR:               Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years …\nOLIVIA:                Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?               \nVICTOR:               Um, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft. (Q27)\nOLIVIA:                Yes. I wonder how fast it went.                 \nVICTOR:               Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Island.\nOLIVIA:                Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn’t he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.                      \nVICTOR:               No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.\nOLIVIA:                Oh, yes, that’s right.\nVICTOR:               But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process. (Q28)\nOLIVIA:                I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today (Q29), like he did with his raft trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.                \nVICTOR:               Yes. Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition. (Q30)\nOLIVIA:                Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter – I found it really challenging!                              \nVICTOR:               Well, it’s a complex issue …\nOLIVIA:                I thought the book had lots of good points. What did you think of …\nSECTION 4\nWell, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of management. And what I’m going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years. It isn’t a scientific, statistical analysis – just some ideas for us to discuss.\nOne area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products (Q31). Consumers will have much more choice – for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations (Q32). We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very fast (Q33). This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.\nI think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions (Q34). Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them, which is the model of years ago.\nAnother influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened. (Q35)\nMany societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we’re going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind (Q36). And when they’re completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.\nMore and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being about to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours (Q37) and – something that has been made possible by advances in technology – remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.\n——————-\nManagement styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they’ll need great skills in leadership (Q38), so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.\nIn most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions. (Q39)\nMany of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.\nAnother point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed (Q40), to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.\nOK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.\nTest 03\nSECTION 1\nDIRECTOR:          Good morning. Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you?\nCAROL:                Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter to next year.\nDIRECTOR:          Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you’re her mother?\nCAROL:                That’s right.\nDIRECTOR:          And, can I have your name?\nCAROL:                It’s Carol, Carol Smith. (Example)\nDIRECTOR:          And your daughter’s name?\nCAROL:                It’s Kate.\nDIRECTOR:          Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old. How old is your daughter?\nCAROL:                She’s three now but she turns four next month.\nDIRECTOR:          I’ll put four down because that’s how old she’ll be when she starts. (Q1)\nCAROL:                Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.\nDIRECTOR:          That’s good to hear. And what’s your address?\nCAROL:                It’s 46 Wombat (Q2) Road, that’s W-O-M-B-A-T. Woodside 4032.\nDIRECTOR:          And what’s the phone number?\nCAROL:                Oh … it’s … 3345 9865.\nDIRECTOR:          So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?\nCAROL:                I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.\nDIRECTOR:          Mmm. I’ll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a very popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.\nCAROL:                Oh dear. I suppose Thursday would be all right (Q3) because she has swimming on Friday.\nDIRECTOR:          OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o’clock at night. What time would you like your daughter to start?\nCAROL:                I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I’ll drop her off at 8:30 (Q4). You’re pretty close to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.\nDIRECTOR:          That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she’ll be in. we have two different groups and they’re divided up according to age. There’s the green group. Which is for three- to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group which is for four- to five-year-olds.\nCAROL:                She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.\nDIRECTOR:          Well, I’ll put her in the red group (Q5) and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.\nCAROL:                That sounds fine.\nDIRECTOR:          OK. Let’s move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner. As she’s finishing pretty early, she won’t need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?\nCAROL:                Yes, she’ll only need lunch. (Q6)\n———————\nDIRECTOR:          Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about? Does she have asthma or any hearing problems for example?\nCAROL:                No. But she does need to wear glasses. (Q7)\nDIRECTOR:          Oh, I’ll make a note of that.\nCAROL:                Yes, she’s pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.\nDIRECTOR:          Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details.\nCAROL:                So what sort of information do you need?\nDIRECTOR:          Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time.\nCAROL:                OK. That’d better be my sister … Jenny Ball (Q8). That’s B-A-double L. Her phone number is 3346 7523.\nDIRECTOR:          Great. So she is the child’s aunt? (Q9)\nCAROL:                Yes, that’s right.\nDIRECTOR:          I’ll make a note of that as well. Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?\nCAROL:                What about payment? How much are the fees each term?\nDIRECTOR:          Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450 altogether.\nCAROL:                OK, and do I have to pay that now?\nDIRECTOR:          No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre. You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.\nCAROL:                Oh, I’ll do that then (Q10). I find it easier to budget that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet.\nDIRECTOR:          Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well. Well, that’s everything. Would you like me to show you around …?\nSECTION 2\nINTERVIEWER:   Today we’re pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about the Trust, Alice.\nALICE:                  Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country – although it’s still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education – last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns – for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth (Q11&amp;Q12). It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist – with dolphin expertise – to monitor populations. Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things. (Q11&amp;Q12)\nI should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year – for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood (Q13). In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it’ll have this effect.\nINTERVIEWER:   Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?\nALICE:                  Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, exploration creates a lot of underwater noise (Q14). It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.\nThis is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place. I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t put the book down – I was hooked. (Q15)\n—————————\nINTERVIEWER:   I’m sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the ‘Adopt a Dolphin’ scheme. Can you tell us about that?\nALICE:                  Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers (Q16) but we remain optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force – Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but it is Kiwi who’s our real ‘character’ as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times (Q17). They all have their own personalities – Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson has a lot of energy – he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour (Q18). You’d probably expect him to be the youngest – he’s not quite – that’s Kiwi – but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme (Q19). Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but Moondancer’s easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify (Q20). So, yes, they’re all very different …\nINTERVIEWER:   Well, they sound a fascinating group …\nSECTION 3\nMIA:      Hi, Rob. How’s the course going?\nROB:      Oh, hi, Mia. Yeah, great. I can’t believe the first term’s nearly over.\nMIA:      I saw your group’s performance last night at the student theatre. It was good.\nROB:      Really? Yeah … but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis. I don’t know where to start. Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.\nMIA:      Well, what was your starting point?\nROB:      Er … my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.\nMIA:      OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it?\nROB:      He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though.\nMIA:      So how did you manage to capture that?\nROB:      I’d … I’d visualise what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients. (Q21)\nMIA:      OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.\nROB:      Right.\nMIA:      Then there’s the issue of atmosphere – so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ (Q22)\nROB:      Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.\nMIA:      Yes, all those details of the production.\nROB:      And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group – what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn’t agree.\nMIA:      Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?\nROB:      Sophia did. That was OK – she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production. And that made me feel better, I suppose. (Q23)\nMIA:      When you understood what needed doing?\nROB:      Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach.\nMIA:      Like what?\nROB:      Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting. (Q24)\nMIA:      Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome?\nROB:      Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene – what’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own.\nMIA:      The one in the wheelchair?\nROB:      Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight – and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage (Q25) … but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.\nMIA:      Yes, it was fine on the night.\n———————–\nROB:      But while you’re here, Mia. I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?\nMIA:      Yes, definitely. It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.\nROB:      I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very competitive – there’s only a limited number of places.\nMIA:      Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules. Only students with good marks get places – you have to prove that you know your subject really well. (Q26)\nROB:      Right. So how did you choose where to go?\nMIA:      Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on you (Q27). Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so you do need to get a move on at that stage (Q28). You’ll find that certain places are very popular with everyone.\nROB:      And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage?\nMIA:      Yes.\nROB:      Right. I’ll get some of the final year students to give me some tips (Q29) … maybe see if I can read what they wrote.\nMIA:      I think that’s a very good idea. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don’t make the mistake I made. I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year. Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules (Q30). You don’t want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms.\nROB:      Right.\nSECTION 4\nToday, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says that a person’ focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement (Q31). Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.\nIn a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person’s personality (Q32) and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other (Q33). For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend (Q34). In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.\nResearch has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains (Q35). They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change.\nWhen people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their “ought” self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.\n———————–\nNow that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation (Q36). In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development (Q37). In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision (Q38). All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers.\nIn contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them (Q39). While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a prevention focus.\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation (Q40) is needed, a promotion focus is probably better. In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.\nTest 04\nSECTION 1\nMR THORNDYKE:    Thorndyke’s\nEDITH:                  Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Speaking. How can I help?\nEDITH:                  I’ve got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat and I wonder whether you’d be able to do the work.\nMR THORNDYKE:    I’m sure I’d be able to help but let me take down a few details.\nEDITH:                  Yes, of course.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?\nEDITH:                  It was my friend May Hampton (Example) … you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago. Do you remember?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.\nEDITH:                  Yes, she is.\nMR THORNDYKE:    And what’s your name, please?\nEDITH:                  It’s Edith Pargetter. (Q1)\nMR THORNDYKE:    Edith … can you spell your surname, please?\nEDITH:                  It’s P-A-R-G-E-double T-E-R.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Double T, right. And do you live in West Park Flats as well?\nEDITH:                  No, actually it’s East (Q2) Park, Flat 4.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, right, that’s over the road, I seem to remember – quite difficult to get to.\nEDITH:                  Yes, it’s at the back of the library. (Q3)\nMR THORNDYKE:    Right, I know. And what’s your phone number?\nEDITH:                  875934 but I’m out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.\nMR THORNDYKE:    So would the best time to ring you be in the morning? (Q4)\nEDITH:                  Yes.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. I’ve made a note of that. Can I just ask, I’ll be in a van and I know parking’s rather difficult round your flats. Where would you recommend?\nEDITH:                  Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the postbox on the other side of the road from the entrance. (Q5)\nMR THORNDYKE:    Good, thanks.\nEDITH:                  And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, yes, I’ll list all the jobs separately with individual prices. (Q6)\nEDITH:                  That’d be a great help.\nMR THORNDYKE:    No problem.\n——————————-               \nMR THORNDYKE:    Now, what would you like me to do?\nEDITH:                  Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen. With all the weather damage, the glass in the door has cracked and I’d need that fixing …\nMR THORNDYKE:    I presume you mean replacing? (Q7)\nEDITH:                  Oh, yes. And as soon as possible …\nMR THORNDYKE:    What I’ll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.\nEDITH:                  Thank you so much. The other things aren’t so urgent but …\nMR THORNDYKE:    Now, I’ll make a note of everything you want doing.\nEDITH:                  Well, in the kitchen I’d like some painting doing.\nMR THORNDYKE:    All the kitchen walls?\nEDITH:                  Just the area over the cooker (Q8). It’s very greasy …\nMR THORNDYKE:    Right … it does tend to get that way!\nEDITH:                  Yes!\nMR THORNDYKE:    Well, if you want a proper job done what I’d need to do is strip the old paint and plaster it about a week before I paint it. (Q9)\nEDITH:                  Of course. Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.\nMR THORNDYKE:    That’s right.\nEDITH:                  Well, I’d like you to replace a fence. (Q10)\nMR THORNDYKE:    Just one?\nEDITH:                  Yes, at the far end.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. Shouldn’t be a problem.\nEDITH:                  And that’s the lot.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.\nEDITH:                  That’s great, thank you.\nMR THORNDYKE:    So, I’ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at …\nSECTION 2\nWelcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life. All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.\nThe port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon – boats can go no higher up this river – and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea (Q11), which is over 23 miles away. A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country (Q12). And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.\nIn the early days, the ores had been smelted – or processed – in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances. (Q3)\nSadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area (Q14). The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it (Q15). Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year, is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest copper port in the country’.\n——————\nBut what can you do and see on your visit today? Here are just a few highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners (Q16). Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water. But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine. (Q17)\nThe next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world (Q18). And it’s recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour (Q19). This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions. Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called ‘The George’. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the shop’s wheel which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman. We have no idea how it got there but it’s been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck – we don’t recommend you allow young children to use them. (Q20)\nSo we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port and will tell your friends all about us.\nSECTION 3\nTIM:                      Hi, Laura – could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer? I’m thinking of doing one myself …\nLAURA:                Hi, Tim. Sure.\nTIM:                      Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?\nLAURA:                That’s right … It’s only a very small company and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment. It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.\nTIM:                      What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you already had … Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?\nLAURA:                We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.\nTIM:                      Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritizing things? You always used to say you had trouble with that … (Q21&amp;Q22)\nLAURA:                Oh, definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions (Q21&amp;Q22), because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.\nTIM:                      It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.\nLAURA:                Absolutely. It was really worthwhile … But you know, the company benefited too …\nTIM:                      Yes, they must have done. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house, presumably they’d have paid a lot more?\nLAURA:                Oh, yes. I worked it out – it would have been 250 per cent more (Q23&amp;Q24). And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site. The company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university. The new brochure looks really professional; it enhances the image of the company straight away (Q23&amp;Q24).\nTIM:                      So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?\nLAURA:                That’s the idea. Yeah.\n———————–\nTIM:                      Well, all in all it sounds very positive – I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself. How do I go about it?\nLAURA:                It’s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP – S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details – I expect you can download one from their website.\nTIM:                      Actually, they’ve got copies in the psychology department – I’ve seen them there. I’ll just go to the office and pick one up. (Q25)\nLAURA:                Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone …\nTIM:                      I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.\nLAURA:                One of the career officers would be better (Q26), they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.\nTIM:                      OK …\nLAURA:                And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP – you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.\nTIM:                      And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?\nLAURA:                They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be proactive, and get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27). Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.\nTIM:                      I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?\nLAURA:                Not really … But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments. (Q28)\nTIM:                      And do I reply directly to them?\nLAURA:                Yes, you do. STEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer.\nTIM:                      Right … So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it? (Q29)\nLAURA:                That’s right. They’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.\nTIM:                      Is that all then?\nLAURA:                More or less. Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that. And that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q3). He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.\nTIM:                      Well, thanks very much for the information – I’m starting to look forward …\nSECTION 4\nToday we’re going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything. However, as we’ll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.\nThere’s no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation. However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities (Q31). Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about nanotechnology – with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.\nSo how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling (Q32). They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research.\nBut as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology (Q33). I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology. We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s look at some of its possible uses.\n————————–\nThanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation with the production of more durable metals (Q34). These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people (Q35) and opening up to totally new holiday destination.\nIn terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory but will be about the size of a sugar cube (Q36). Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present. (Q37)\nBut nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively (Q38). And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected – as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms – then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn’t be any waste. (Q39)\nThe notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.\nBut it’s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days (Q40). There’s even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.\nAs you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades. Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don’t know."},"IELTS/Listening/Audioscripts-Cam-10-Listening":{"slug":"IELTS/Listening/Audioscripts-Cam-10-Listening","filePath":"IELTS/Listening/Audioscripts Cam 10 Listening.md","title":"Audioscripts Cam 10 Listening","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Test 01\nSECTION 1\n\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Good morning. World Tours. My name is Jamie. How can I help you?\nANDREA:             Good morning. I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA. Could you send me a brochure^[brochure = tờ quảng cáo / tờ rơi giới thiệu du lịch.]?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Of course. Could I have your name please?\nANDREA:             Andrea Brown.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Thank you. And your address?\nANDREA:             24, Ardleigh Road. \nTRAVEL AGENT:   Can you spell that?\nANDREA:             A-R-D-L-E-I-G-H Road.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Postcode?\nANDREA:             BH5 2OP\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Thanks. And can I have your phone number?\nANDREA:             Is a mobile alright?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Fine.\nANDREA:             It’s 07786643091.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about^[heard about = “nghe nói về”.] World Tours? From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?\nANDREA:             No, I read about you in the newspaper.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post^[get … in the post = gửi qua bưu điện.] to you but can I give you some information over the phone^[over the phone = qua điện thoại.]. What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?\nANDREA:             I’m interested in going^[be interested in + V-ing = “quan tâm / thích làm gì”.] to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car^[hire a car = thuê xe].\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK. We have a couple of^[a couple of: Chỉ hai hoặc một vài sự vật cùng loại] self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one begins in Los Angeles and there’s plenty of time^[plenty of time: nhiều thời gian] to visit some of the theme parks^[theme park = “công viên giải trí theo chủ đề”.] there.\nANDREA:             That’s something on my children’s list so I’d want to include that.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite^[campsite: địa điểm cắm trại].\nANDREA:             I don’t like the idea of staying^[the idea of V-ing = “ý tưởng về việc làm gì”.] in a tent . It’d be too hot.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.\nANDREA:             OK.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   The other trip we can arrange^[arrange: to plan or organize something in advance] is slightly different^[slightly different = hơi khác một chút.]. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria.\nANDREA:             Someone told me there’s a really nice castle near Cambria. Will we go near that?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.\nANDREA:             Good. I’d like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert^[the desert: sa mạc]?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.\nANDREA:             We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   OK. Well you could go straight on^[go straight on = “đi thẳng tới”.] to San Diego.\nANDREA:             That’s good for beaches isn’t it? \nTRAVEL AGENT:   That’s right, that’s a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.\nANDREA:             I don’t think so. We want some time^[some time → một ít thời gian] for sunbathing and swimming.\n—————————–\nANDREA:             So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers 2,020  kilometres^[covers … kilometres = “đi qua / bao phủ quãng đường … km”.]. The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres. The cost is £525 per person. That includes accommodation^[accommodation = chỗ ở.], car rental^[car rental = tiền thuê xe.] and a flight  but no meals.\nANDREA:             OK. And the other trip?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether^[altogether = tổng cộng.].\nANDREA:             So is that cheaper then?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s £429  per person, which is a good deal.\nANDREA:             So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?\nTRAVEL AGENT:   They aren’t included. But these hotels offer dinner  in the price.\nANDREA:             OK. Well, thank you very much. I’ll be in touch^[be in touch: We’ll be in touch soon. – Chúng tôi sẽ liên lạc sớm.] when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.\nTRAVEL AGENT:   I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.\nANDREA:             Goodbye.\nSECTION 2\nOn behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club I’ll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.\nOur greatest asset is probably our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn’t Olympic-sized, but now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s much wider. This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.\nOur recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from trampolining to yoga.\n——————–\nOne thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems . One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you.\nThe trainer will then take you through the safety rules  for using the equipment in the fitness suite. During your next exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It’s very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries. There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!\nAt the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period . This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.\nNow, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of £90  in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP Clubs . There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot will be a great advantage. Individual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.\nPremier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times . This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members. Premier membership is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for guests every month . The monthly fee is £65.\nYou don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms, but it’s very important to remember your photo card  because you won’t be able to get in without it.\nFor people who aren’t working during the day then …\nSECTION 3\nJOHN:                   Erm … hello Professor, I’m John Wishart. I’m working on my entry for the Global Design Competition. My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.\nPROFESSOR:       Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it?\nJOHN:                   Well, it’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.\nPROFESSOR:       I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?\nJOHN:                   Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.\nPROFESSOR:       I see, that sounds tricky. And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?\nJOHN:                   Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different.\nPROFESSOR:       That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?\nJOHN:                   Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.\nPROFESSOR:       And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?\nJOHN:                   Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone.\nPROFESSOR:       So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.\nJOHN:                   That’s right.\nPROFESSOR:       It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?\nJOHN:                   Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.\nPROFESSOR:       In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?\nJOHN:                   The idea is to pressurize the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.\nPROFESSOR:       Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens once the dishes are clean?\nJOHN:                   Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas . Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system.\nPROFESSOR:       It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope.\nJOHN:                   Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again.\nPROFESSOR:       What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?\nJOHN:                   Probably not, but that’s OK.\nPROFESSOR:       Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.\n——————————-\nPROFESSOR:       Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?\nJOHN:                   Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time. I have to give a presentation, and that’s the part I was hoping you could help me with.\nPROFESSOR:       Right, well that should be easy enough. What have you managed to do so far?\nJOHN:                   Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.\nPROFESSOR:       I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a model of the machine.\nJOHN:                   Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.\nPROFESSOR:       What is the main difficulty so far? Let me guess – is it the materials?\nJOHN:                   Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive.\nPROFESSOR:       Look, projects like this are very important to us. They really help lift our profile. So why don’t you talk to the university about a grant?  I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.\nJOHN:                   That would be a great.\nPROFESSOR:       You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well. For a global competition such as this you need to make sure the technical details you’ve given are accurate and thorough.\nJOHN:                   That would be a great help.\nPROFESSOR:       Is there anything else I can do?\nJOHN:                   Well, I’m really …\nSECTION 4\nToday we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family. One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few . Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power . Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area.\nThe white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams . Keeping these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.\nToday, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands . There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment – in other words, their ecosystem.\n———————–\nThe greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites have also been lost . The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment.\nall these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low.\nAnd so, what’s the situation going forward? Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem. The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method , which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.\nOther steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion . The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes …\nTest 02\nSECTION 1\n\nINTERVIEWER:   Excuse me.\nLUISA:                  Yes?\nINTERVIEWER:   I wonder^[wonder: muốn biết, tự hỏi] if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport. It won’t take long^[t won’t take long = sẽ không mất nhiều thời gian].\nLUISA:                  No, that’s fine.\nINTERVIEWER:   Lovely. The survey is on behalf of^[on behalf of = thay mặt cho, đại diện cho] the local council^[local council = chính quyền địa phương]. They’d like to know about what transport you use any suggestions for improvement^[suggestions for improvement = các đề xuất để cải thiện]. Can I start by asking^[start by doing something = bắt đầu bằng việc làm gì] you how you travelled to town today?\nLUISA:                  Sure. I came on the bus.\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself?\nLUISA:                  OK.\nINTERVIEWER:   What’s your name?\nLUISA:                  It’s Luisa …\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes.\nLUISA:                  Hardie.\nINTERVIEWER:   Can you spell that, please?\nLUISA:                  Yes, it’s H-A-R-D-I-E.\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. Thanks. And can I have your address?\nLUISA:                  It’s 19 , White Stone Road.\nINTERVIEWER:   Oh, right. I know that area. It’s Bradfield, isn’t it?\nLUISA:                  That’s right.\nINTERVIEWER:   Is the postcode GT7?\nLUISA:                  It’s actually G-T-8, 2-L-C.\nINTERVIEWER:   Great. And could I ask what your job is? Are you a student?\nLUISA:                  I’ve actually just finished my training. I’m a hairdresser^[hairdresser = thợ làm tóc].\nINTERVIEWER:   Oh, right. And one more question in this section. What is the reason for you coming^[the reason for + V-ing = lý do cho việc gì] into town today?\nLUISA:                  Actually it’s not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason, but to see the dentist^[to see the dentist = đi khám nha sĩ (see + doctor/dentist → đi gặp để khám)].\nINTERVIEWER:   Right. Thanks.\n—————————-                   \nINTERVIEWER:   Now in this last section I’d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements^[facilities and arrangements = cơ sở vật chất và sắp xếp (giao thông, tiện ích…)] in the city for getting to and from work^[to and from work = đi làm và tan làm], er, any suggestions you have for improvements.\nLUISA:                  Well, something I’ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift^[a later shift = ca làm muộn], I think the lighting should be better.\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes, good point.\nLUISA:                  And of course, I think it’s a real shame^[it’s a real shame = thật đáng tiếc] they’ve been cutting down on^[cut down on = cắt giảm] the number of footpaths^[footpaths = lối đi bộ]. They should have more of those. Then people would walk more.\nINTERVIEWER:   Yes, right.\nLUISA:                  And, I don’t think there are enough trains. That’s why I don’t use them – you have to wait so long^[you have to wait so long = bạn phải chờ rất lâu].\nINTERVIEWER:   Thanks. And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling. As you may know, there’s a drive^[there’s a drive = có một chiến dịch / nỗ lực (drive = campaign)] in the city to get more people to cycle to work.\nLUISA:                  Right.\nINTERVIEWER:   But we realise that^[realise that = nhận ra rằng] there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help^[might do to help = có thể làm để giúp] encourage^[encourage = khuyến khích] workers to cycle to work.\nLUISA:                  Yep. Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes^[no safe places to leave your bikes = không có chỗ an toàn để gửi xe].\nINTERVIEWER:   OK.\nLUISA:                  And also, I’d have to^[I’d have to = I would have to → diễn tả tình huống giả định] cycle uphill^[uphill = lên dốc] and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty^[pretty sweaty = khá là đổ mồ hôi (pretty = quite)] so I think I’d need a shower^[I’d need a shower = tôi sẽ cần một chỗ tắm] somewhere at work.\nINTERVIEWER:   Right.\nLUISA:                  And I suppose^[I suppose = tôi cho rằng (nói nhẹ nhàng hơn “I think”)] the last thing is that I wouldn’t be all that confident^[wouldn’t be all that confident = sẽ không quá tự tin] about cycling on such busy roads. I think I’d like to see you offering training^[offering training = cung cấp khóa đào tạo / huấn luyện] for that , you know. I’d feel a lot better about starting if that was the case^[if that was the case = nếu điều đó xảy ra].\nINTERVIEWER:   Well, that’s very helpful. Thank you very much for your time.\nLUISA:                  No problem. Bye.\nSECTION 2\nGood morning. I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public , in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC – the South West Regional Development Commission.\nFirst of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits is so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system – the only one of its kind in the world – which enables seawater to be used in the pool.\nNow, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract , but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s.\nWe hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have.\n————————\nAnd now, moving on the Central Park Playground, which we’re pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for safety: the news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into sex areas showing different parts of the world – each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on – fauna native to the forests of the region . Moving south to the Antarctic – we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains  – I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America – and here the theme is El Dorado – games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones . And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate – I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the international Space Station . Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other fortifications . Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent.\nNow, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we’d love to see you there – so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.\nSECTION 3\nVICTOR:               Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl?\nOLIVIA:                Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things.\nVICTOR:               That’s right, he had his own the little museum. And I think it’s unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies; I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example.\nOLIVIA:                Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think …\nVICTOR:               No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man.\nOLIVIA:                Oh, right … After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a small island, to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people’s lifestyles.\nVICTOR:               As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut of by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do.\nOLIVIA:                An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that.                          \nVICTOR:               OK.\n————————-\nOLIVIA:                All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration: Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.\nVICTOR:               Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land.\nOLIVIA:                Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes.               \nVICTOR:               Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake – sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia?\nOLIVIA:                Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible.                      \nVICTOR:               Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years …\nOLIVIA:                Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?               \nVICTOR:               Um, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft.\nOLIVIA:                Yes. I wonder how fast it went.                 \nVICTOR:               Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Island.\nOLIVIA:                Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn’t he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.                      \nVICTOR:               No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.\nOLIVIA:                Oh, yes, that’s right.\nVICTOR:               But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process.\nOLIVIA:                I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today , like he did with his raft trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.                \nVICTOR:               Yes. Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition.\nOLIVIA:                Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter – I found it really challenging!                              \nVICTOR:               Well, it’s a complex issue …\nOLIVIA:                I thought the book had lots of good points. What did you think of …\nSECTION 4\nWell, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of management. And what I’m going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years. It isn’t a scientific, statistical analysis – just some ideas for us to discuss.\nOne area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products . Consumers will have much more choice – for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations . We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very fast . This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.\nI think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions . Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them, which is the model of years ago.\nAnother influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened.\nMany societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we’re going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind . And when they’re completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.\nMore and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being about to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours  and – something that has been made possible by advances in technology – remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.\n——————-\nManagement styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they’ll need great skills in leadership , so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.\nIn most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions.\nMany of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.\nAnother point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed , to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.\nOK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.\nTest 03\nSECTION 1\nDIRECTOR:          Good morning. Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you?\nCAROL:                Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling^[enrolling = ghi danh, đăng ký học] my daughter to next year.\nDIRECTOR:          Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you’re her mother?\nCAROL:                That’s right.\nDIRECTOR:          And, can I have your name?\nCAROL:                It’s Carol, Carol Smith.\nDIRECTOR:          And your daughter’s name?\nCAROL:                It’s Kate.\nDIRECTOR:          Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater^[cung cấp dịch vụ cho, phục vụ cho] for children from three to five years old. How old is your daughter?\nCAROL:                She’s three now but she turns four next month.\nDIRECTOR:          I’ll put four down^[put down: ghi lại, viết xuống.] because that’s how old she’ll be when she starts.\nCAROL:                Fine, she’s so excited about^[so excited about = rất háo hức, phấn khích về điều gì] her birthday and coming to the centre.\nDIRECTOR:          That’s good to hear. And what’s your address?\nCAROL:                It’s 46 Wombat  Road, that’s W-O-M-B-A-T. Woodside 4032.\nDIRECTOR:          And what’s the phone number?\nCAROL:                Oh … it’s … 3345 9865.\nDIRECTOR:          So, have you decided on^[decide on = quyết định về điều gì] the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?\nCAROL:                I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible^[if possible = nếu có thể].\nDIRECTOR:          Mmm. I’ll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a very popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.\nCAROL:                Oh dear. I suppose Thursday would be all right  because she has swimming on Friday.\nDIRECTOR:          OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible^[flexible = linh hoạt] start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o’clock at night. What time would you like your daughter to start?\nCAROL:                I need to get to work^[get to work: đến chỗ làm] in the city by 9:00 so I’ll drop her off^[drop sb off: cho ai đó xuống xe.] at 8:30 . You’re pretty close^[pretty close = khá gần] to the city here so that should^[should: diễn tả một kỳ vọng hoặc một điều có khả năng cao sẽ xảy ra.] give me plenty of time^[plenty of time: nhiều thời gian, đủ thời gian.] to get there.\nDIRECTOR:          That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she’ll be in. we have two different groups and they’re divided up according to^[divided up according to = chia theo] age. There’s the green group. Which is for three- to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group which is for four- to five-year-olds.\nCAROL:                She’s quite mature for her age^[quite mature for her age = khá trưởng thành so với tuổi] and she can already write her name and read a little.\nDIRECTOR:          Well, I’ll put her in the red group  and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.\nCAROL:                That sounds fine.\nDIRECTOR:          OK. Let’s move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner. As^[as: because] she’s finishing pretty early, she won’t need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?\nCAROL:                Yes, she’ll only need lunch.\n———————\nDIRECTOR:          Now, does she have any medical conditions^[medical conditions = tình trạng sức khỏe / bệnh lý] we need to know about? Does she have asthma^[asthma = bệnh hen suyễn] or any hearing problems for example?\nCAROL:                No. But she does need^[“does” được dùng trước động từ “need” để nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của việc đó.] to wear glasses^[wear glasses = đeo kính].\nDIRECTOR:          Oh, I’ll make a note of that.\nCAROL:                Yes, she’s pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.\nDIRECTOR:          Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details.\nCAROL:                So what sort of^[sort of = loại, kiểu] information do you need?\nDIRECTOR:          Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you^[get hold of sb (idiom): liên lạc được với ai đó.] at any time.\nCAROL:                OK. That’d better be^[That’d better be (That had better be)…: Nên là… (gợi ý tốt nhất)] my sister … Jenny Ball . That’s B-A-double L. Her phone number is 3346 7523.\nDIRECTOR:          Great. So she is the child’s aunt? \nCAROL:                Yes, that’s right.\nDIRECTOR:          I’ll make a note of that as well. Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?\nCAROL:                What about payment? How much are the fees each term^[term = học kỳ]?\nDIRECTOR:          Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450 altogether.\nCAROL:                OK, and do I have to pay that now?\nDIRECTOR:          No, we send out invoices once^[once = khi mà] the children start at the centre. You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.\nCAROL:                Oh, I’ll do that then . I find it easier to budget that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet^[not used to … yet = chưa quen với …].\nDIRECTOR:          Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well. Well, that’s everything. Would you like me to show you around …?\nSECTION 2\nINTERVIEWER:   Today we’re pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about the Trust, Alice.\nALICE:                  Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country – although it’s still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education – last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns – for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist – with dolphin expertise – to monitor populations. Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things.\nI should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year – for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood . In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it’ll have this effect.\nINTERVIEWER:   Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?\nALICE:                  Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, exploration creates a lot of underwater noise . It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.\nThis is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place. I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t put the book down – I was hooked.\n—————————\nINTERVIEWER:   I’m sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the ‘Adopt a Dolphin’ scheme. Can you tell us about that?\nALICE:                  Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers  but we remain optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force – Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but it is Kiwi who’s our real ‘character’ as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times . They all have their own personalities – Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson has a lot of energy – he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour . You’d probably expect him to be the youngest – he’s not quite – that’s Kiwi – but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme . Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but Moondancer’s easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify . So, yes, they’re all very different …\nINTERVIEWER:   Well, they sound a fascinating group …\nSECTION 3\nMIA:      Hi, Rob. How’s the course going?\nROB:      Oh, hi, Mia. Yeah, great. I can’t believe the first term’s nearly over.\nMIA:      I saw your group’s performance last night at the student theatre. It was good.\nROB:      Really? Yeah … but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis. I don’t know where to start. Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.\nMIA:      Well, what was your starting point?\nROB:      Er … my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.\nMIA:      OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it?\nROB:      He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though.\nMIA:      So how did you manage to capture that?\nROB:      I’d … I’d visualise what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients.\nMIA:      OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.\nROB:      Right.\nMIA:      Then there’s the issue of atmosphere – so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ \nROB:      Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.\nMIA:      Yes, all those details of the production.\nROB:      And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group – what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn’t agree.\nMIA:      Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?\nROB:      Sophia did. That was OK – she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production. And that made me feel better, I suppose.\nMIA:      When you understood what needed doing?\nROB:      Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach.\nMIA:      Like what?\nROB:      Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting.\nMIA:      Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome?\nROB:      Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene – what’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own.\nMIA:      The one in the wheelchair?\nROB:      Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight – and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage  … but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.\nMIA:      Yes, it was fine on the night.\n———————–\nROB:      But while you’re here, Mia. I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?\nMIA:      Yes, definitely. It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.\nROB:      I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very competitive – there’s only a limited number of places.\nMIA:      Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules. Only students with good marks get places – you have to prove that you know your subject really well.\nROB:      Right. So how did you choose where to go?\nMIA:      Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on you . Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so you do need to get a move on at that stage . You’ll find that certain places are very popular with everyone.\nROB:      And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage?\nMIA:      Yes.\nROB:      Right. I’ll get some of the final year students to give me some tips  … maybe see if I can read what they wrote.\nMIA:      I think that’s a very good idea. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don’t make the mistake I made. I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year. Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules . You don’t want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms.\nROB:      Right.\nSECTION 4\nToday, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says that a person’ focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement . Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.\nIn a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person’s personality  and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other . For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend . In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.\nResearch has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains . They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change.\nWhen people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their “ought” self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.\n———————–\nNow that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation . In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development . In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision . All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers.\nIn contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them . While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a prevention focus.\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation  is needed, a promotion focus is probably better. In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.\nTest 04\nSECTION 1\nMR THORNDYKE:    Thorndyke’s\nEDITH:                  Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Speaking. How can I help?\nEDITH:                  I’ve got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat and I wonder whether you’d be able to do the work.\nMR THORNDYKE:    I’m sure I’d be able to help but let me take down a few details.\nEDITH:                  Yes, of course.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?\nEDITH:                  It was my friend May Hampton (Example) … you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago. Do you remember?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.\nEDITH:                  Yes, she is.\nMR THORNDYKE:    And what’s your name, please?\nEDITH:                  It’s Edith Pargetter.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Edith … can you spell your surname, please?\nEDITH:                  It’s P-A-R-G-E-double T-E-R.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Double T, right. And do you live in West Park Flats as well?\nEDITH:                  No, actually it’s East  Park, Flat 4.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, right, that’s over the road, I seem to remember – quite difficult to get to.\nEDITH:                  Yes, it’s at the back of the library.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Right, I know. And what’s your phone number?\nEDITH:                  875934 but I’m out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.\nMR THORNDYKE:    So would the best time to ring you be in the morning? \nEDITH:                  Yes.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. I’ve made a note of that. Can I just ask, I’ll be in a van and I know parking’s rather difficult round your flats. Where would you recommend?\nEDITH:                  Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the postbox on the other side of the road from the entrance.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Good, thanks.\nEDITH:                  And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?\nMR THORNDYKE:    Oh, yes, I’ll list all the jobs separately with individual prices.\nEDITH:                  That’d be a great help.\nMR THORNDYKE:    No problem.\n——————————-               \nMR THORNDYKE:    Now, what would you like me to do?\nEDITH:                  Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen. With all the weather damage, the glass in the door has cracked and I’d need that fixing …\nMR THORNDYKE:    I presume you mean replacing? \nEDITH:                  Oh, yes. And as soon as possible …\nMR THORNDYKE:    What I’ll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.\nEDITH:                  Thank you so much. The other things aren’t so urgent but …\nMR THORNDYKE:    Now, I’ll make a note of everything you want doing.\nEDITH:                  Well, in the kitchen I’d like some painting doing.\nMR THORNDYKE:    All the kitchen walls?\nEDITH:                  Just the area over the cooker . It’s very greasy …\nMR THORNDYKE:    Right … it does tend to get that way!\nEDITH:                  Yes!\nMR THORNDYKE:    Well, if you want a proper job done what I’d need to do is strip the old paint and plaster it about a week before I paint it.\nEDITH:                  Of course. Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.\nMR THORNDYKE:    That’s right.\nEDITH:                  Well, I’d like you to replace a fence.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Just one?\nEDITH:                  Yes, at the far end.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. Shouldn’t be a problem.\nEDITH:                  And that’s the lot.\nMR THORNDYKE:    Fine. Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.\nEDITH:                  That’s great, thank you.\nMR THORNDYKE:    So, I’ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at …\nSECTION 2\nWelcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life. All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.\nThe port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon – boats can go no higher up this river – and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea , which is over 23 miles away. A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country . And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.\nIn the early days, the ores had been smelted – or processed – in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances.\nSadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area . The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it . Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year, is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest copper port in the country’.\n——————\nBut what can you do and see on your visit today? Here are just a few highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners . Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water. But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine.\nThe next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world . And it’s recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour . This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions. Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called ‘The George’. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the shop’s wheel which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman. We have no idea how it got there but it’s been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck – we don’t recommend you allow young children to use them.\nSo we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port and will tell your friends all about us.\nSECTION 3\nTIM:                      Hi, Laura – could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer? I’m thinking of doing one myself …\nLAURA:                Hi, Tim. Sure.\nTIM:                      Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?\nLAURA:                That’s right … It’s only a very small company and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment. It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.\nTIM:                      What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you already had … Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?\nLAURA:                We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.\nTIM:                      Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritizing things? You always used to say you had trouble with that … \nLAURA:                Oh, definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions, because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.\nTIM:                      It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.\nLAURA:                Absolutely. It was really worthwhile … But you know, the company benefited too …\nTIM:                      Yes, they must have done. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house, presumably they’d have paid a lot more?\nLAURA:                Oh, yes. I worked it out – it would have been 250 per cent more. And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site. The company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university. The new brochure looks really professional; it enhances the image of the company straight away.\nTIM:                      So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?\nLAURA:                That’s the idea. Yeah.\n———————–\nTIM:                      Well, all in all it sounds very positive – I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself. How do I go about it?\nLAURA:                It’s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP – S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details – I expect you can download one from their website.\nTIM:                      Actually, they’ve got copies in the psychology department – I’ve seen them there. I’ll just go to the office and pick one up.\nLAURA:                Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone …\nTIM:                      I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.\nLAURA:                One of the career officers would be better , they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.\nTIM:                      OK …\nLAURA:                And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP – you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.\nTIM:                      And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?\nLAURA:                They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be proactive, and get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts . Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.\nTIM:                      I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?\nLAURA:                Not really … But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments.\nTIM:                      And do I reply directly to them?\nLAURA:                Yes, you do. STEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer.\nTIM:                      Right … So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it? \nLAURA:                That’s right. They’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.\nTIM:                      Is that all then?\nLAURA:                More or less. Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that. And that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide . He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.\nTIM:                      Well, thanks very much for the information – I’m starting to look forward …\nSECTION 4\nToday we’re going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything. However, as we’ll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.\nThere’s no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation. However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities . Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about nanotechnology – with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.\nSo how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling . They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research.\nBut as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology . I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology. We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s look at some of its possible uses.\n————————–\nThanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation with the production of more durable metals . These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people  and opening up to totally new holiday destination.\nIn terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory but will be about the size of a sugar cube . Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.\nBut nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively . And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected – as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms – then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn’t be any waste.\nThe notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.\nBut it’s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days . There’s even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.\nAs you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.

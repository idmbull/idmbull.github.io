One terrible natural disaster I know is a big flood that happened in Central Vietnam a few years ago. It rained heavily for many days and the rivers became very high. Many houses were under water and people had to move to schools or safe places. Some people lost their animals and farms. The government and volunteers came to help with food and clothes. I saw many pictures on the news, and I felt very sad for the local people. They had to start everything again after the flood. I think floods are very dangerous and we should protect the environment to reduce them.

One natural disaster that I remember clearly is the severe flood in Central Vietnam in 2020. Heavy rain lasted for almost a week, causing rivers to overflow and destroy many villages. Thousands of houses were submerged, and people lost their belongings, crops, and even animals. Many roads were blocked, which made it hard for rescue teams to reach the affected areas. 

I watched the news every day, and the images were heartbreaking. I felt sorry for the people who suffered, especially children and the elderly. Luckily, many volunteers and soldiers came to provide food, water, and clothes. After the flood, people worked together to rebuild their homes. 

This disaster reminded me of how important it is to protect nature and to have good plans for disaster prevention. It also showed the strong spirit and kindness of Vietnamese people.

One unforgettable natural disaster that I witnessed through the media was the massive flood that struck Central Vietnam in late 2020. It was caused by continuous heavy rain and tropical storms over several days, which made rivers overflow and inundate a vast area. Entire villages were underwater; houses, schools, and roads were badly damaged, and many families lost their property and livestock. 

What impressed me most was how quickly people came together to help. Volunteers from different parts of the country donated food, medicine, and money to support the victims. Rescue workers risked their lives to reach isolated areas. Although the scene was tragic, it also showed the compassion and solidarity of Vietnamese people during difficult times. 

Personally, I felt both heartbroken and inspired. It made me realize how powerful nature can be, and how small humans are compared to it. Since then, I’ve become more aware of environmental protection and disaster preparedness.

I want to talk about Ho Chi Minh City. It is the biggest city in Vietnam and it is in the south of the country. The city is very crowded and noisy because there are many people and a lot of motorbikes on the streets. When I went there, I visited Ben Thanh Market, where I could buy clothes and souvenirs. I also tried some delicious food, like noodles and sandwiches. The tall buildings in the center looked very modern and exciting. 

I like this city because it is busy and there are many things to do. Young people can go shopping, watch movies, or meet friends in coffee shops. However, I think sometimes life there is difficult. The traffic is always terrible, and the air is not clean. Even though I enjoyed my trip, I feel living there every day would be a little stressful. 

---

I’d like to describe Hanoi, which is the capital of Vietnam and located in the north of the country. Hanoi is very well-known for its rich culture, historical buildings, and traditional food. The Old Quarter is one of the most popular areas where visitors can walk through small streets and discover many local shops. It is also famous for dishes such as “pho” and “bun cha,” which are considered specialties of the city. 

For young people, Hanoi provides a mix of modern lifestyle and cultural experiences. You can go to shopping malls, cinemas, and cafés, or you can explore historical landmarks like the Temple of Literature or Hoan Kiem Lake. Personally, I enjoy the city because it has both a traditional charm and modern development. However, I must admit that it has problems, especially with traffic congestion and air pollution. These issues sometimes make daily life uncomfortable, but overall Hanoi is still an attractive and lively place to live. 

---

The city I would like to talk about is Singapore, which left a strong impression on me when I visited it two years ago. Although Singapore is a small island nation in Southeast Asia, it is one of the most modern and well-organized cities I have ever seen. 

One of the first things that amazed me was its cleanliness and safety. The streets are spotless, and the rules are very strict, which creates a very disciplined lifestyle. Another remarkable aspect is the public transport system. Trains and buses are always punctual, comfortable, and affordable, so travelling around the city is extremely convenient. 

Singapore also offers a wide range of attractions. For example, I had a chance to see Marina Bay Sands, which is an iconic hotel with an infinity pool on top. I also enjoyed Gardens by the Bay, a futuristic park with giant tree-like structures that light up at night. Moreover, Singapore is multicultural, so I could explore different cuisines in places like Chinatown, Little India, and Arab Street. 

What I admire most is that Singapore successfully balances rapid economic development with environmental protection. Green spaces are everywhere, and the government pays attention to sustainability. Although the cost of living is relatively high, I think the quality of life there is absolutely worth it. For me, it is a dream city to live in.

#### Why 'Think Outside the Box' Is Bad Advice

Raise your hand if you've ever been in a brainstorming meeting, and you’ve heard someone (usually the boss) say that everyone needs to ‘think outside the box!’ This advice is normally met with nods, yeses, and other signs of approval. And that’s because it seems to make so much sense. If you’re trying to come up with something truly innovative, then of course you shouldn’t be thinking about the problem the same way as everyone else. If you do, you’ll just end up with the same product or service as the competition. And no one wants to be a copycat when they’re trying to be innovative.

Recently this exact brainstorming scenario happened to me - even the part where I found myself nodding in approval. But the more I thought about it, the more confused I got. What exactly does this phrase ‘think outside the box’ mean? And is it actually good advice? In order to figure out this out, let’s first talk about what this phrase even means.

**‍Removing the Ambiguity**

The phrase “think outside the box” is confusing because it’s ambiguous. What exactly is ‘the box’? Sometimes this phrase is thrown out there to imply that our final product, service, or solution needs to be different than what already exists. This isn’t bad advice necessarily, but it’s just not actionable. The phrase isn’t clear in telling us what to do. More often than not, this advice is given when a team gets stuck thinking about the practical sides of a problem. The person telling the team to “think outside the box” is trying to get the team to stop thinking about the practical constraints or boundaries of the problem. People often think that these constraints constrain their creativity. They’ll say things like ‘well if we just didn’t have to think about all these real-world factors, then our design would be awesome! It would really allow us to think outside the box.’ With this new lens for looking at the phrase, my initial question about whether or not this is good or bad advice can be stated more clearly as:

When we’re trying to come up with an innovative solution, is it better to think about the boundaries of the problem or should we just ignore them and “think freely”?

**Embrace the Boundaries**

While it might seem like letting our minds wander freely is the best way for us to be creative, we’re here to tell you that this isn’t true. There are three reasons why it’s better to think about the boundaries of your problem as opposed to simply ignoring them in order to ‘think outside the box.’

**Off to the Races**

The first reason boundaries supercharge creativity is because they mitigate the ‘paradox of choice’. This phrase was coined by Barry Schwartz in his book appropriately entitled The Paradox of Choice: Why Less Is More. In it, he argues that today’s world is full of too many options to the point that we are all overwhelmed trying to find the perfect choice and thus less happy as a society. The key takeaway for us here is that it’s really hard to choose between a lot of options. So when we’re innovating without boundaries, the possibilities — and the choices — are endless. We literally have too many choices to fathom. This can be overwhelming and lead to a creativity block. We can find ourselves stressing about our inability to think through everything. When this happens we shut down. With established boundaries, though, the potential starting points for our ideas are much clearer.

**Picking the Best**

The second reason boundaries supercharge creativity speaks to the other half of Barry Schwartz’s ‘paradox of choice’ argument. Not only are people paralyzed by too many choices, but they actually make awful decisions when they’re overloaded with options. No matter how skilled you might think you are at sifting through countless options, study after study has shown that the decision-making capacity of your brain works kind of like a bank. The more power you withdraw for one decision, the less you have to put toward the next. Neuroscientists refer to this as “psychological depletion.” And researchers have found that when people try to make decisions when they are already psychologically depleted, they’ll actually end up making really awful ones. They’ll choose worse places to live, do worse on basic math problems, and more!

**Optimize Your Time**

The final way boundaries supercharge your creative process is by helping to focus your time on areas where you can have the biggest impact. All of us have spent enough time solving problems to know that they don’t come with a perfect turn-by-turn roadmap for how to solve them. This doesn’t mean that there isn’t an overall process that we can follow, it just means that every problem is different and comes with a whole slew of different paths that you could take to solve that problem. With so many possible paths, we have to make sure that we’re spending our time wisely. One way to do that is by focusing on the boundaries. Because without boundaries, you could pursue an idea for months that never had a shot at being implemented. Not only would that be a huge waste, but it would leave you with very little if any, time to work on an idea that is within the bounds of what’s possible.

**Be Careful of the Advice to ‘Think Outside the Box’**

Taken together, these three superpowers of boundaries help take your creativity to the next level. By reducing choice, you’ve given yourself a clear realm within which to start your brainstorming, rather than an intimidating vast blank canvas. Boundaries also give you the opportunity to evaluate all of the viable directions rather than leave you guessing about which might be the best path to pursue. Finally, boundaries focus your creative energies right where you want them: on ideas that can make a difference.

So the next time you hear someone tell you to ‘think outside the box’ instead of nodding your head, take the opportunity to make sure everyone’s on the same page about the boundaries of the problem. Despite common wisdom to the contrary, focusing on these boundaries will actually help us be more innovative.



### Đọc trả lời câu hỏi

The big growth in people and cities is causing some big issues in many places. To deal with these problems, some governments are saying businesses should move to the countryside. While this strategy may offer certain benefits, it also brings about drawbacks that, in my opinion, outweigh the advantages.  
On the one hand, the relocation of businesses to rural areas can bring several merits. First, it can make life in big cities easier by taking off some of the pressure on things like housing and transportation. With fewer businesses and workers in cities, there could be fewer cars on the roads, resulting in less commuting time and stress. Second, moving businesses to the countryside can make new jobs for local communities. These companies can create jobs in things like transportation and logistics, helping with problems like not having enough jobs in rural places.  
On the other hand, there are notable disadvantages associated with relocating businesses to rural areas. First, businesses might find it hard to get workers with the right skills. In rural places, there are not as many people, so it's not easy to find workers with the requisite skills and qualifications . This can make it hard for businesses to work well. Moreover, moving to rural places can make transportation and logistics more expensive. These areas are far from big transportation centers, and the roads might not be as good as in cities, which makes it harder and costlier to move products.  
In conclusion, while there are certain advantages to relocating businesses to rural areas, I firmly believe that the disadvantages, particularly concerning increased costs and a potential shortage of skilled labor, outweigh these benefits.  

**✍️ Exercise 1: Vocabulary – Fill in the blanks**
Replace the missing words using the provided list:
Words: drawbacks – commuting – notable – requisite – merits – associated

Relocating businesses to rural areas may offer certain **merits**, such as reducing pressure on cities.
One of the most **notable** disadvantages is the shortage of skilled labor.
Moving away from cities is **associated** with higher transport costs.
Longer **commuting** time is a major problem in big cities.
Many rural workers lack the **requisite** skills to meet company demands.
Despite some advantages, the **drawbacks** seem to outweigh the benefits.

**✍️ Exercise 2: Grammar – Correct the errors**
Identify and correct the grammar/word choice mistakes:

The big growth in people and cities is causing some big issues in many places.
Some governments are saying businesses should move to the countryside.
With fewer businesses and workers in cities, there could be fewer cars on the roads, resulting in less commuting time and stress.
This make them to less appreciate very high. (← not from this essay, but similar mistake style).

**✍️ Exercise 3: Paraphrasing Practice**
Rewrite these sentences in a more academic style:

Make life in big cities easier by taking off some of the pressure on things like housing and transportation.
👉

In rural places, there are not as many people, so it's not easy to find workers with the requisite skills.
👉 _____

These areas are far from big transportation centers, and the roads might not be as good as in cities.
👉 _____

**✍️ Exercise 4: Ideas – Critical Thinking**
Answer in 1–2 sentences each:

Apart from jobs and traffic, what other benefits might relocating businesses bring to rural areas?

What alternative solutions could governments consider instead of relocating businesses?

Do you think technology (e.g., remote work, AI) could reduce the disadvantages of moving businesses to rural areas? How?

### Describe a place you visited recently.

Last month, I had the chance to visit Da Nang with my family, and we spent three unforgettable days which allowed us to enjoy the breathtaking coastline. While we were strolling along My Khe Beach at sunset, we noticed dozens of tourists playing volleyball and taking photos. Da Nang is a very clean and friendly city, and people are always willing to help strangers. I have visited several places in Vietnam, but Da Nang has impressed me the most so far. I will definitely return next year, and by then, I hope I will have discovered more hidden gems such as Ba Na Hills and the Marble Mountains.

#### **PART 1**

AMBER:               Hello William. This <span class="htd">is</span> Amber – you <span class="qkd">said</span> to phone^[you said to phone = you said (that I should) phone] if I <span class="qkd">wanted to get</span> more information about the job agency you mentioned^[the job agency you mentioned = công ty môi giới việc làm mà bạn nhắc đến]. <span class="htd">Is</span> now a good time?

WILLIAM:            Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I <span class="qktd">was talking</span> about <span class="htd">is called</span> Bankside – <span class="htd">they’re based</span> in^[be based in: cách nói trang trọng hơn located in] Docklands – I <span class="modal-verb">can tell</span> you the address now – 497 Eastside.

AMBER:               OK, thanks. So <span class="htd">is</span> there anyone in particular^[anyone in particular → “một người nào đó cụ thể”] I <span class="modal-verb">should speak</span> to there?

WILLIAM:            The agent^[The agent who/that I always deal with] I always deal with^[deal with somebody = làm việc/giải quyết với ai đó] <span class="htd">is called</span> Becky Jamieson.

AMBER:               Let me <span class="htd">write</span> that down – Becky …

WILLIAM:            Jamieson (Q1) J-A-M-I-E-S-O-N.

AMBER:               <span class="htd">Do you have</span> her direct line^[số điện thoại trực tiếp]?

WILLIAM:            Yes, <span class="htd">it’s</span> in my contacts somewhere – right, here we <span class="htd">are</span>: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I <span class="modal-verb">wouldn’t call</span> her until the afternoon if I <span class="qkd">were</span> you – <span class="htd">she’s</span> always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. <span class="htd">She’s</span> really helpful and friendly so<span class="htd"> I’m</span> sure it <span class="modal-verb">would be</span> worth^[it would be worth: Cấu trúc mang nghĩa đáng để làm gì] getting in touch with her^[getting in touch with her: Cụm động từ, có nghĩa là liên lạc với cô ấy hoặc kết nối với cô ấy] for an informal chat^[an informal chat: một cuộc trò chuyện thân mật].
 
AMBER:               <span class="htd">It’s</span> mainly clerical and admin jobs^[clerical and admin jobs: công việc hành chính văn phòng] they <span class="htd">deal</span> with, <span class="htd">isn’t</span> it?


WILLIAM:            <span class="htd">That’s</span> right. I <span class="htd">know</span> <span class="httd">you’re hoping</span> to find a full-time job in the media eventually – but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff^[temporary staff: nhân viên tạm thời] for the finance sector^[finance sector: nghành tài chính] – which <span class="tld">will look</span> good on your CV – and generally <span class="htd">pays</span> better too.

AMBER:               Yeah – <span class="htd">I’m</span> just a bit worried because I <span class="htd">don’t have</span> much office experience.

WILLIAM:            I wouldn’t worry. <span class="tld">They’ll probably</span> start you as a receptionist^[receptionist: nhân viên lễ tân], or something like that. So <span class="htd">what’s</span> important for that kind of job <span class="httd">isn’t so much having </span>business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – <span class="htd">it’s</span> communication that really matters – so <span class="modal-verb">you’d be</span> fine there. And <span class="tld">you’ll pick up</span> office skills really quickly on the job. <span class="htd">It’s not</span> that complicated.

AMBER:               OK good. So how long <span class="htd">do people generally need</span> temporary staff for? It<span class="modal-verb"> would be</span> great if I <span class="modal-verb">could get</span> something lasting at least a month.

WILLIAM:            That <span class="modal-verb">shouldn’t be</span> too difficult. But <span class="htd">you’re</span> more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which <span class="modal-verb">might get</span> extended. <span class="htd">It’s</span> unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.

AMBER:               Right, <span class="htht">I’ve heard</span> the pay isn’t too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.


WILLIAM:            Oh yes – definitely. The hourly rate <span class="htd">is</span> about £10, 11 if <span class="htd">you’re</span> lucky.


AMBER:               <span class="htd">That’s </span>pretty good. I <span class="qktd">was only expecting</span> to get eight or nine pounds an hour.

————————————————

WILLIAM:            <span class="htd">Do you want</span> me to tell you anything about the registration process?

AMBER:               Yes, please. I <span class="htd">know</span> you<span class="modal-verb"> have to have</span> an interview.

WILLIAM:            The interview usually <span class="htd">takes</span> about an hour and you <span class="modal-verb">should arrange</span> that about a week in advance^[about a week in advance (trước khoảng một tuần)].

AMBER:               I <span class="htd">suppose</span> I <span class="modal-verb">should dress</span> smartly if <span class="htd">it’s</span> for office work – I <span class="modal-verb">can probably</span> borrow a suit from Mum.

WILLIAM:            Good idea. <span class="htd">It’s</span> better to look too smart than too casual.

AMBER:               <span class="htd">Will I need</span> to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?

WILLIAM:            No – they <span class="htd">don’t need</span> to see those, I <span class="htd">don’t think</span>.

AMBER:               What about my passport?

WILLIAM:            Oh yes – they <span class="htd">will ask</span> to see that.

AMBER:               OK.

WILLIAM:            I <span class="modal-verb">wouldn’t get</span> stressed about the interview though. <span class="htd">It’s</span> just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they <span class="htd">can try and match</span> you to a job which <span class="tld">you’ll like</span>. So there <span class="htd">are</span> questions about personality that they always <span class="htd">ask</span> candidates – fairly basic ones. And they probably <span class="tld">won’t ask </span>anything too difficult like what your plans <span class="htd">are</span> for the future.

AMBER:               Hope not.

WILLIAM:            Anyway, there <span class="htd">are</span> lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview <span class="tld">will be</span> useful because <span class="tld">they’ll give</span> you feedback on your performance so you <span class="modal-verb">can improve</span> next time.

AMBER:               And <span class="tld">they’ll have</span> access to jobs which <span class="htd">aren’t</span> advertised.

WILLIAM:            Exactly – most temporary jobs <span class="htd">aren’t</span> advertised.

AMBER:               And I <span class="htd">expect</span> finding a temporary job this way <span class="htd">takes</span> a lot less time – <span class="htd">it’s</span> much easier than ringing up individual companies.

WILLIAM:            Yes indeed. Well I <span class="htd">think</span> …

### **TEST 2**

#### **PART 1**

TIM:       Good morning. <span class="htd">You’re</span> through to^[“be through to” (khi gọi điện thoại) = bạn đã được kết nối với …] the tourist information office, Tim speaking. How <span class="modal-verb">can I help</span> you?

JEAN:     Oh hello. <span class="modal-verb">Could you give</span> me some information about next month’s festival, please? My family and <span class="tltd">I will be staying</span> in the town that week.

TIM:       Of course. Well it <span class="htd">starts</span> with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.

JEAN:     Oh I <span class="qkd">heard</span> about that. The orchestra and singers^[The orchestra and singers = dàn nhạc và ca sĩ] <span class="htd">come</span> from the USA, <span class="htd">don’t</span> they?

TIM:       <span class="htd">They’re</span> from Canada. <span class="htd">They’re</span> very popular over there. <span class="tld">They’re going to perform</span> a number of well-known pieces^[well-known pieces = những tác phẩm nổi tiếng] that <span class="tld">will appeal</span> to children as well as adults.

JEAN:     That sounds good. My whole family^[My whole family = cả gia đình tôi] are interested in music.


TIM:       The next day, the 18th, <span class="htd">there’s</span> a performance by a ballet company <span class="htd">called</span> Eustatis.

JEAN:     Sorry?

TIM:       The name <span class="htd">is</span> spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S. They <span class="qkd">appeared</span> in last year’s festival, and <span class="qkd">went</span> down very well^[went down very well = được đón nhận (tốt/xấu) bởi khán giả/người nghe]. Again, their programme^[programme = program] <span class="htd">is designed</span> for all ages.

JEAN:     Good. I <span class="htd">expect</span> <span class="tld">we’ll go to</span> that. I <span class="htd">hope</span> <span class="tld">there’s going to be</span> a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.

TIM:       <span class="htd">You’re</span> in luck! On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group^[a local amateur group = một nhóm nghiệp dư địa phương] <span class="httd">are performing</span> one written by a member of group. <span class="htd">It’s called</span> Jemima. <span class="tld">That’ll be</span> on in the town hall^[in the town hall = ở tòa thị chính].<span class="htht"> They’ve already performed</span> it two or three times. I <span class="htht">haven’t seen</span> it myself, but the review in the local paper^[in the local paper = trên tờ báo địa phương] <span class="qkd">was</span> very good.

JEAN:     And <span class="htd">is </span>it suitable for children?

TIM:       Yes, in fact <span class="htd">it’s aimed</span> more at children than at adults, so both performances <span class="htd">are</span> in the afternoon.

JEAN:     And what about dance? <span class="tld">Will there be</span> any performances?

TIM:       Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company <span class="httd">is putting</span> on a show of modern pieces, with electronic music by young composers.

JEAN:     Uh-huh.

TIM:       The show <span class="htd">is</span> about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other, so it’s got^[it’s got = (cách nói thân mật, Anh-Anh) = it has] the rather strange name^[the rather strange name = cái tên khá lạ], Chat. 

JEAN:     I suppose <span class="htd">that’s</span> because <span class="htd">that’s</span> something we do both face to face and online.

TIM:       <span class="htd">That’s</span> right.

———————-

TIM:       Now there <span class="htd">are</span> also some workshops and other activities. <span class="tld">They’ll all take place</span> at least once every day, so everyone who<span class="htd"> wants</span> to take part will have a chance.

JEAN:     Good. <span class="htd">We’re</span> particularly interested in cookery – you <span class="htd">don’t happen</span> to have^[Happen to V = làm một việc gì đó một cách hoàn toàn tình cờ, không tính trước] a cookery workshop, <span class="htd">do</span> you?


TIM:       We certainly <span class="htd">do</span>. <span class="httd">It’s going to</span> focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle, and <span class="tld">it’ll show</span> that even sweet things like cakes^[even sweet things like cakes → ngay cả những món ngọt như bánh] <span class="modal-verb">can contain</span> much less sugar than they usually do.

JEAN:     That might be worth going^[be worth doing sth → cấu trúc: đáng để làm gì] to. <span class="httd">We’re trying to</span> encourage our children to cook.

TIM:       Another workshop <span class="htd">is</span> just for children, and <span class="htd">that’s</span> on creating posters to reflect the history of the town. The aim <span class="htd">is</span> to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives <span class="htht">have changed</span> over the centuries. The results <span class="tld">will be exhibited</span> in the community centre. Then the other workshop <span class="htd">is</span> in toy-making, and <span class="htd">that’s</span> for adults only.

JEAN:     Oh, <span class="htd">why’s</span> that?

TIM:       Because it <span class="htd">involves</span> carpentry – participants <span class="tltd">will be making</span> toys out of wood, so <span class="tld">there’ll be</span> a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.

JEAN:     It <span class="htd">makes</span> sense to keep children away from it.

TIM:       Exactly. Now let me <span class="htd">tell</span> you about some of the outdoor activities. There’ll be supervised wild swimming …

JEAN:     Wild swimming? <span class="htd">What’s</span> that?

TIM:       It just <span class="htd">means</span> swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.

JEAN:     Oh OK. In a lake, for instance.

TIM:       Yes, <span class="htd">there’s</span> a beautiful one just outside the town^[just outside the town → ngay bên ngoài thị trấn], and <span class="tld">that’ll be</span> the venue for the swimming. <span class="tld">There’ll be</span> lifeguards on duty, so <span class="htd">it’s</span> suitable for all ages. And finally, <span class="tld">there’ll be</span> a walk in some nearby woods every day. The leader <span class="htd">is</span> an expert on insects. <span class="tld">He’ll show</span> some that live in the woods, and how important they <span class="htd">are</span> for the environment. So <span class="tld">there are going to be</span> all sorts of different things to do during the festival.

JEAN:     There certainly <span class="htd">are</span>.

TIM:       If <span class="modal-verb">you’d like</span> to read about how the preparations for the festival <span class="httd">are going</span>, the festival organizer <span class="httd">is keeping</span> a blog. Just search online for the festival website, and <span class="tld">you’ll find</span> it.

JEAN:     Well, <span class="htd">thank</span> you very much for all the information.

TIM:       <span class="htd">You’re</span> welcome. Goodbye.

JEAN:     Goodbye.

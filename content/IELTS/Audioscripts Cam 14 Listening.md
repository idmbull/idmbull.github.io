## **TEST 1**

### **SECTION 1**

OFFICER:         Good morning. What <span class="htd">can I do</span> for you?

LOUISE:           I <span class="htd">want to report</span> a theft. I <span class="qkd">had some things stolen</span> out of my bag yesterday.

OFFICER:         <span class="htd">I’m </span>sorry to hear that. Right, so <span class="tld">I’ll need </span>to take a few details. <span class="htd">Can I start</span> with your name?

LOUISE:           Louise Taylor. 

OFFICER:         OK, <span class="htd">thank</span> you. And <span class="htd">are</span> you resident in the UK?

LOUISE:           No, <span class="htd">I’m</span> actually Canadian. Though my mother <span class="qkd">was</span> British.

OFFICER:         And your date of birth?

LOUISE:           December 14th, 1977.

OFFICER:         So <span class="httd">you’re just visiting</span> this country?

LOUISE:           That’s right. I <span class="htd">come</span> over most summers^[hầu hết mùa hè] on business. <span class="htd">I’m</span> an interior designer^[nhà thiết kế nội thất] and I <span class="htd">come</span> over to buy old furniture, antiques you know. There <span class="htd">are</span> some really lovely things around here, but you <span class="htd">need to get out</span> to the small towns. <span class="htht">I’ve had</span> a really good trip this year, until this <span class="qkd">happened</span>.

OFFICER:         OK. So <span class="htht">you’ve been</span> here quite a while?^[I’ve been here for a long time._ ≈ _I’ve been here quite a while.]

LOUISE:           Yes, <span class="htd">I’m</span> here for two months. I <span class="htd">go back</span> next week.

OFFICER:         So may I <span class="htd">ask</span> where <span class="httd">you’re staying</span> now?      

LOUISE:           Well at present <span class="htht">I’ve got</span> a place at Park Apartments, <span class="htd">that’s</span> on King Street. I ==was staying== at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there <span class="qkd">was</span> only available for six weeks so I <span class="qkd">had to</span> find another one.

OFFICER:         OK. And the apartment number?

LOUISE:           Fifteen.

LOUISE:           Right.

…………………………………………..

OFFICER:         Now, I <span class="htd">need to take</span> some details of the theft. So you <span class="qkd">said</span> you <span class="qkd">had</span> some things <span class="qkd">stolen</span> out of your bag?

LOUISE:           <span class="htd">That’s</span> right.

OFFICER:         And ==were you actually carrying== the bag when the theft <span class="qkd">took place</span>?

LOUISE:           Yes, I really <span class="htd">can’t understand</span> it. I <span class="qkd">had</span> my backpack on. And I <span class="qkd">went into</span> a supermarket to <span class="htd">buy</span> a few things and when I <span class="qkd">opened</span> it up my wallet <span class="qkd">wasn’t</span> there.

OFFICER:         And what <span class="qkd">did</span> your wallet have in it?

LOUISE:           Well, fortunately I <span class="htd">don’t keep</span> my credit cards in that wallet – I <span class="htd">keep</span> them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there <span class="qkd">was</span> quite a bit of cash there … about £250 sterling, I should <span class="htd">think</span>. I <span class="qkd">withdrew</span> £300 from my account yesterday, but I <span class="qkd">did</span> a bit of shopping, so I must <span class="htht">have already spent</span> about £50 of that.

OFFICER:         OK.

LOUISE:           At first I <span class="qkd">thought</span>, oh I must <span class="htht">have left</span> the wallet back in the apartment, but then I <span class="qkd">realised</span> my phone ==had gone== as well. It <span class="qkd">was</span> only a week old, and <span class="htd">that’s</span> when I <span class="qkd">realised</span> I’d been robbed^[I had been robbed → thì quá khứ hoàn thành bị động]. Anyway at least they <span class="qkd">didn’t take</span> the keys to my rental car.

OFFICER:         Yes. So you <span class="htd">say</span> the theft <span class="qkd">occurred</span> yesterday?

LOUISE:           Yes.

OFFICER:         So that <span class="qkd">was</span> September the tenth. And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly ==have been stolen==?

LOUISE:           Well at first I <span class="qkd">couldn’t believe</span> it because the bag ==had been== on my back ever since I <span class="qkd">left</span> the apartment after lunch. <span class="htd">It’s</span> just a small backpack, but I generally <span class="htd">use</span> it when <span class="httd">I’m travelling</span> because it <span class="htd">seems</span> safer than a handbag. Anyway, I <span class="qkd">met up</span> with a friend, and we <span class="qkd">spent</span> a couple of hours^[a couple of hours: Cụm danh từ, tân ngữ, chỉ khoảng thời gian.] in the museum. But I <span class="htd">do remember </span>that as we ==were leaving== there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys <span class="qkd">ran up</span> to us, and they ==were really crowding== round us, and they ==were asking== us that time it <span class="qkd">was</span>, then all of a sudden^[all of a sudden: Thành ngữ (idiom), mang nghĩa "bất thình lình."] they <span class="qkd">ran off</span>.

OFFICER:         <span class="htd">Can you remember</span> anything about them?

LOUISE:           The one who <span class="qkd">did</span> most of the talking ==was wearing== a T-shirt with a picture of something … let’s see … a tiger.

OFFICER:         Right. Any idea of how old he <span class="qkd">might have been</span>?

LOUISE:           Around twelve years old?

OFFICER:         And <span class="htd">can you remember</span> anything else about his appearance?

LOUISE:           Not much. He <span class="qkd">was</span> quite thin …

OFFICER:         Colour of hair?

LOUISE:           I <span class="htd">do remember</span> that – he was blond. All the others <span class="qkd">were</span> dark-haired.

OFFICER:         And any details of the others?

LOUISE:           Not really. They <span class="qkd">came</span> and went so quickly.

OFFICER:         Right. So what <span class="httd">I’m going to do</span> now is <span class="htd">give</span> you a crime reference number so you <span class="htd">can contact</span> your insurance company. So this <span class="htd">is</span> ten digits: 

LOUISE:           <span class="htd">Thank</span> you. So <span class="qkd">should</span> I …

I<span class="modal-verb">’d like</span> to start with some general advice about being an apprentice^[Tôi muốn bắt đầu bằng một vài lời khuyên chung về việc làm một người học việc]. Most of you^[Hầu hết các bạn] <span class="htd">have</span> very little or no experience of working for a big organisation^[ có rất ít hoặc thậm chí chưa có kinh nghiệm làm việc cho một tổ chức lớn] and the first week or so <span class="httd">may be</span> quite challenging^[và khoảng tuần đầu tiên có thể sẽ khá là đầy thử thách]. There <span class="tld">will be</span> a lot of new information to take in^[Sẽ có rất nhiều thông tin mới cần phải tiếp thu] but don’t worry too much about trying to remember everything^[nhưng đừng quá lo lắng về việc phải cố gắng nhớ hết tất cả mọi thứ]. The important thing^[Điều quan trọng nhất] <span class="htd">is</span> to check with someone^[là phải hỏi ý kiến ai đó] if <span class="htd">you’re</span> not sure^[nếu bạn không chắc chắn] what to do^[phải làm gì] – <span class="tld">you’ll find</span> your supervisor <span class="htd">is</span> very approachable^[người hướng dẫn của bạn rất dễ gần] and <span class="tld">won’t mind</span> explaining things or helping you out^[và không ngại giải thích mọi thứ hoặc giúp đỡ bạn]. <span class="htd">You’re</span> here to learn^[Bạn ở đây là để học hỏi] so make the most of^[tận dụng tối đa] that opportunity^[vì vậy hãy tận dụng tối đa cơ hội đó đi]. <span class="qkhttd">You’ll be spending</span> time^[Bạn sẽ dành thời gian] in different departments^[ở các phòng ban khác nhau] during your first week^[trong tuần đầu tiên của bạn] so make an effort^[vì vậy hãy cố gắng] to talk to as many people as possible^["as many... as possible": cấu trúc so sánh ngang bằng, có nghĩa là "càng nhiều... càng tốt".] about their work^[ thế nên nhớ chủ động bắt chuyện với thật nhiều đồng nghiệp để tìm hiểu về công việc của họ] – <span class="tld">you’ll make</span> some new friends^[Bạn không những có thêm bạn mới] and <span class="htd">find out</span> lots of useful information^[mà còn học hỏi được vô số điều bổ ích].

As well as having a supervisor^[Ngoài việc có người giám sát], <span class="tld">you’ll each be assigned</span> a mentor^[mỗi người còn được phân công một người hướng dẫn nữa]. This person <span class="tld">will be</span> someone <span class="htht">who’s recently completed</span> an apprenticeship^[Người này sẽ là một người vừa mới hoàn thành chương trình học việc] and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis^[và bạn sẽ gặp người cố vấn này hàng tuần]. Their role <span class="htd">is</span> to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship^[Vai trò của người cố vấn là cung cấp sự giúp đỡ và hỗ trợ xuyên suốt quá trình học việc của bạn]. Of course^[dĩ nhiên], this <span class="htd">doesn’t mean</span> <span class="tld">they’ll actually do</span> any of your work for you^[họ sẽ thực sự làm thay bất kỳ công việc nào của bạn] – instead^[thay vào đó] <span class="tltd">they’ll be asking</span> you^[họ sẽ hỏi bạn] about what goals <span class="htht">you’ve achieved</span> so far^[về những mục tiêu nào bạn đã đạt được cho đến nay], as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement^[đồng thời hỗ trợ bạn nhận ra các mặt cần trau dồi thêm]. You can also discuss^[bạn cũng có thể thảo luận] your more long-term ambitions^[kế hoạch dài hạn của bản thân] with them as well^[với họ nữa].

————————–

Now I <span class="htd">just want to run</span> through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you^[Bây giờ tôi chỉ muốn cùng bạn điểm qua một vài chính sách của công ty về chương trình học việc của chúng ta]… Most importantly, the internet^[Quan trọng nhất là internet]. As part of your job^[Là một phần công việc của bạn] <span class="tltd">you’ll be doing</span> some research online^[bạn sẽ thực hiện một số nghiên cứu trực tuyến] so obviously <span class="tlht">you’ll have unlimited</span> access for that^[hiển nhiên là bạn sẽ có quyền truy cập không giới hạn cho việc đó] but please <span class="htd">don’t use</span> it for personal use^[nhưng làm ơn đừng sử dụng nó cho mục đích cá nhân] – <span class="tld">you’ll have</span> your own phones for that^[bạn sẽ có điện thoại của riêng mình để làm việc đó].

Some of you <span class="htht">have already asked</span> me about flexible working^[Một số bạn đã hỏi tôi về cách làm việc linh hoạt]. After your probationary three-month period^[Sau thời gian ba tháng thử việc] – some of you <span class="tld">will be</span> eligible for this^[một số bạn sẽ đủ điều kiện cho điều này] – but it <span class="tld">will depend</span> on which department <span class="htd">you’re</span> in^[nhưng điều đó sẽ phụ thuộc vào việc bạn làm ở bộ phận nào] and what your personal circumstances are^[hoàn cảnh cá nhân của bạn là gì]. So please <span class="htd">don’t </span>assume <span class="tld">you’ll automatically be permitted</span> to do this^[Vì vậy, làm ơn đừng mặc định cho rằng bạn sẽ tự động được cho phép làm điều này].

I <span class="htd">want to</span> make sure^[tôi muốn đảm bảo chắc chắn] <span class="htd">there’s</span> no confusion about our holiday policy^[không có sự nhầm lần nào về chính sách nghỉ phép của chúng tôi]. Apart from^[Apart from: ngoài trừ] any statutory public holidays^[any statutory public holidays: các ngày nghỉ lễ theo quy định] we <span class="htd">ask</span> that^[chúng tôi yêu cầu rằng] you <span class="htd">don’t book</span> any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship <span class="htht">has finished</span>. Time off^[thời gian nghỉ phép] <span class="modal-verb">should only be taken</span> if you <span class="htd">are</span> unwell. Please <span class="htd">speak</span> to your supervisor if this <span class="tld">is going to</span> be a problem.

<span class="htd">You’ll be expected</span>^[yêu cầu, mong đợi] to work a 40-hour week but there <span class="modal-verb">may be</span> opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although <span class="htd">you’re</span> not required to do this, it <span class="modal-verb">can be</span> a valuable experience^[kinh nghiệm quý giá] – so we <span class="htd">advise</span> you to take it up if possible. Obviously, we <span class="htd">understand</span> that people <span class="htd">do have</span> commitments outside work, so <span class="htd">don’t</span> worry if there are times^[there are times = có những lúc] when you <span class="htd">are</span> unavailable.

As you <span class="htd">know</span>, we <span class="htd">don’t have</span> a formal dress code here – you <span class="modal-verb">may wear</span> casual clothes as long as^[as long as = miễn là] <span class="htd">they’re</span> practical – and the only restriction^[the only restriction … is on … = sự hạn chế duy nhất … là …] for shoes we <span class="htd">have</span> is on high heels^[high heels = giày cao gót] for health and safety reasons. Comfortable shoes like trainers^[trainers = giày thể thao] <span class="htd">are</span> preferable.

<span class="htd">There’s</span> a heavily subsidised canteen^[a heavily subsidised canteen = một căn tin được trợ giá nhiều] on site where you <span class="httd">can get</span> hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks <span class="htd">are also provided</span> – so <span class="htht">we’ve decided</span> to introduce a no packed lunch policy. This <span class="htd">is</span> partly to encourage^[partly to encourage: một phần để khuyến khích] healthy eating at work and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which <span class="htd">is</span> unhygienic.

OK moving on to …

### **SECTION 3**

TUTOR:            OK, so what I’d like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning. You should have done most of the reading now, so I’d like you to share your ideas, and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.

CARLA:            OK Rob. I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – cities built next to the sea. It made it much easier to find relevant information.

ROB:                Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s population lives in cities now.

CARLA:            Yeah, though that’s all cities, not just ones on the coast. But (**Q21**) **most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea**. I’d not realised that before.

ROB:                Nor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.

CARLA:            Why?

ROB:                Well, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except (**Q22**) **it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers**.

CARLA:            So these are brought downstream to the cities?

ROB:                Right. Hmm. Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?

CARLA:            No.

ROB:                Well, apparently back in the 1950s they build channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.

CARLA:            Sounds sensible.

ROB:                Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them. (**Q23**) **But what they didn’t take into account was global warming**. So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level, and now sea levels are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The whole design was faulty.

CARLA:            So what are the authorities doing about it now?

ROB:                I don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste into the ocean over the next ten years.

CARLA:            But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?

ROB:                No. Really (**Q24**) **they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels**, in order to protect against flooding now. But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.

CARLA:            Right. Really, though, coastal cities can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.

ROB:                Absolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them, so (**Q25**) **they should be able to work together** to some extent. But it’s going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by.

CARLA:            Yes, if they ever do.

——————————

CARLA:            So I think we’ve probably got enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.

ROB:                OK. So I suppose we’ll begin with some general historical background about why coastal cities were established. But (**Q26**) **we don’t want to spend too long on that**, the other students will already know a bit about it. It’s all to do with communications and so on.

CARLA:            Yes. We should mention some geographical factors, things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on. We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.

ROB:                On a handout you mean? Or (**Q27**) **some slides everyone can see**?

CARLA:            Yeah, that’d be better.

ROB:                It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?

CARLA:            Yes, (**Q28**) **We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk**. I don’t think the other students will have read it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.

ROB:                OK. So that’s probably enough background.

CARLA:            So then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.

ROB:                OK. What else do we need to talk about? Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.

CARLA:            Yeah. We’ll need to do a bit of work there, I haven’t got much information, have you?

ROB:                No. (**Q29**) **We’ll need to look at some websites**. Shouldn’t take too long.

CARLA:            OK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe (**Q30**) **we could ask people in the audience**. We’ve got people from quite a lot of different places.

ROB:                That’d be interesting, if we have time, yes. So now shall we …

### **SECTION 4**

Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem. Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding (**Q31**) **industry**. Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a number of years now, scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline marine renewable energy – also called ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.

Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories: wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion, and I’ll say a few words about each one.

First, wave energy. Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method. This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is (**Q32**) **constant**, and there’s no danger of waves coming to s standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir, or offshore systems. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every (**Q33**) **direction**. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line. Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean (**Q34**) **floor** might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.

——————————–

The second category of marine energy that I’ll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy is that it’s (**Q35**) **predictable**: we know the exact time of high and low tides for years to come.

For tidal energy to be effective, the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth. But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon, an area of sea water separated from the sea.

One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a (**Q36**) **bay** at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity. Then, for three hours as the tide goes out, the water is held back within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea. Then, in order to release the stored water, (**Q37**) **gates** in the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.

This system has quite a lot in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the turbines are operated without the need for (**Q38**) **fuel**, so it doesn’t create any greenhouse gas emissions; and very little maintenance is needed. It’s estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create than 2,000 (**Q39**) **jobs**, a big boost to the local economy.

On the other hand, there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing (**Q40**) **migration** patterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.

There are other forms of tidal energy, but I’ll go on to the third category of marine energy: ocean thermal energy conversion. This depends on there being a big difference in temperature between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe. The concept dates back to 1881, when …

CARL:               Well, <span class="hthttd">I’ve been getting</span> a pain in my knee, the left one. Not very serious at first, but <span class="htht">it’s gotten</span> worse, so I <span class="qkd">thought</span> I <span class="htd">ought to see</span> someone about it.

JULIE:               <span class="htd">That’s</span> certainly the right decision. So how long <span class="htht">have you been</span> aware of this pain? <span class="htd">Is</span> it just a few days, or <span class="htd">is</span> it longer than that?

CARL:               Longer. <span class="htht">It’s been</span> worse for the last couple of days, but <span class="htd">it’s</span> three weeks since I first <span class="qkd">noticed</span> it. It <span class="qkd">came on</span> quite gradually though, so I kind of <span class="qkd">ignored</span> it at first.

JULIE:               And <span class="htht">have you taken</span> any medication yourself, or <span class="qkd">treated</span> it in anyway?

CARL:               Yeah, <span class="hthttd">I’ve been taking</span> medication to deal with the pain. Tylenol, and that <span class="htd">works</span> OK for a few hours. But I <span class="htd">don’t like </span>to keep taking it.

JULIE:               OK. And what about heat treatment? <span class="htht">Have you tried</span> applying heat at all?

CARL:               No, but I <span class="hthttd">have been using ice</span> on it for the last few days.

JULIE:               And <span class="htd">does that seem to help</span> the pain at all?

CARL:               A little, yes.

JULIE:               Good. Now you <span class="htd">look</span> as if <span class="htd">you’re</span> quite fit normally?

CARL:               <span class="htd">I am</span>, yes.

JULIE:               So do you do any sport on a regular basis?

CARL:               Yes, I <span class="htd">play</span> a lot of tennis. I <span class="htd">belong</span> to a club so I <span class="htd">go</span> there a lot. <span class="htd">I’m</span> quite competitive so I <span class="htd">enjoy</span> that side of it as well as the exercise. But I <span class="htht">haven’t gone</span> since this <span class="qkd">started</span>.

JULIE:               Sure. And <span class="htd">do you do</span> any other types of exercise?

CARL:               Yeah, I sometimes <span class="htd">do</span> a little swimming, but usually just when <span class="htd">I’m</span> on vacation. But normally I <span class="htd">go</span> running a few times a week, maybe three or four times.

JULIE:               Hmm. So your legs <span class="httd">are getting</span> quite a pounding. But you <span class="htht">haven’t had</span> any problems up to now?

CARL:               No, not with my legs. I <span class="qkd">did have</span> an accident last year when I <span class="qkd">slipped</span> and <span class="qkd">hurt</span> my shoulder, but <span class="htd">that’s</span> better now.

JULIE:               Excellent. And <span class="htd">do you have</span> any allergies?

CARL:               No, none that <span class="htd">I’m</span> aware of.

JULIE:               And <span class="htd">do you take</span> any medication on a regular basis?

CARL:               Well, I <span class="htd">take</span> vitamins but <span class="htd">that’s</span> all. <span class="htd">I’m</span> generally very healthy.

JULIE:               OK, well let’s <span class="htd">have</span> a closer look and <span class="htd">see</span> what might <span class="httd">be causing</span> this problem. If you can just <span class="htd">get up</span> …

### **SECTION 2**

<span class="tltd">We’ll be arriving</span> at Branley Castle in about five minutes^[Chúng ta sẽ đến lâu đài Branley trong khoảng 5 phút nữa], but before we <span class="htd">get</span> there <span class="tld">I’ll give</span> you a little information about the castle and what our visit <span class="tld">will include</span>^[nhưng trước khi đến đó, tôi sẽ cung cấp cho bạn một ít thông tin về lâu đài và những gì chuyến thăm của ta sẽ bao gồm].

So in fact <span class="htht">there’s been</span> a castle on this site for over eleven hundred years^[Thực tế đã có một lâu đài tại đây hơn mười một thế kỷ]. The first building <span class="qkd">was</span> a fort constructed in 914 AD^[Công trình đầu tiên là một pháo đài được xây dựng vào năm 914 sau công nguyên] for defence against Danish invaders^[để phòng thủ chống lại quân xâm lược Đan Mạnh] by King Alfred the Great’s daughter^[do con gái Vua Alfred Đại Đế cho xây], who ruled England at the time^[người mà lúc đó đang cai trị nước Anh]. In the following century^[trong thế kỷ tiếp theo], after the Normans <span class="qkd">conquered</span> England^[sau khi người Normans chinh phục nước Anh], the land <span class="qkd">was given</span> to a nobleman called Richard de Vere^[mảnh đất được trao cho một quý tộc tên là Richard de Vere], and he <span class="qkd">built</span> a castle there^[và ông ta đã xây một lâu đài ở đó] that <span class="qkd">stayed</span> in the de Vere family for over four hundred years^[lâu đài ấy thuộc về gia tộc de Vere trong hơn 400 năm].

However^[tuy nhiên], when Queen Elizabeth I <span class="qkd">announced</span> that she <span class="qktd">was going to</span> visit the castle in 1576^[khi Nữ hoàng Elizabeth I thông báo rằng bà sẽ đến thăm lâu đài vào năm 1576] it <span class="qktd">was beginning to</span> look a bit run down^[lâu đài bắt đầu có vẻ hơi xuống cấp], and it <span class="qkd">was decided</span> that rather than repair the guest rooms^[và người ta quyết định rằng thay vì sửa chữa các phòng dành cho khách], <span class="modal-verb">they’d make</span> a new house for her out of wood^[out of + material = “làm từ … / bằng …”] next to the main hall^[họ sẽ xây một ngôi nhà mới bằng gỗ bên cạnh đại sảnh. ]. She <span class="qkd">stayed</span> there for four nights^[Bà ấy đã ở đó bốn đêm] and apparently it <span class="qkd">was</span> very luxurious^[và rõ ràng là nó rất sang trọng], but unfortunately it <span class="qkd">was destroyed</span> a few years later by fire^[nhưng tiếc là nó đã bị hỏa hoạn thiêu rụi vài năm sau đó.].

In the seventeenth century^[Vào thế kỷ XVII] the castle <span class="qkd">belonged</span> to the wealthy Fenys family^[lâu đài thuộc về gia đình Fenys giàu có], who <span class="qkd">enlarged</span> it and <span class="qkd">made</span> it more comfortable^[họ đã mở rộng nó và làm cho nó thoải mái hơn.]. However^[tuy nhiên], by 1982 the Fenys family <span class="modal-verb">could no longer afford</span> to maintain the castle^[đến năm 1982, gia đình Fenys không còn khả năng duy trì lâu đài], even though they <span class="qkd">received</span> government support^[mặc dù họ đã nhận được sự hỗ trợ của chính phủ], and they <span class="qkd">put</span> it on the market^[và họ đã rao bán nó trên thị trường]. It <span class="qkd">was eventually taken</span> over by a company who <span class="qkd">owned</span> a number of amusement parks^[Cuối cùng nó đã được tiếp quản bởi một công ty sở hữu một số công viên giải trí], but when we get there^[nhưng khi chúng ta đến đó] I <span class="htd">think</span> <span class="tld">you’ll see</span> that <span class="htht">they’ve managed</span> to retain the original atmosphere of the castle^[ tôi nghĩ bạn sẽ thấy rằng họ đã cố gắng giữ lại bầu không khí ban đầu của lâu đài.].

When you <span class="htd">go</span> inside^[Khi bạn đi vào bên trong], <span class="tld">you’ll find</span> that in the state rooms^[bạn sẽ thấy trong các phòng khánh tiết] there <span class="htd">are</span> life-like moving wax models^[những mô hình tượng sáp chuyển động giống như thật] dressed in costumes of different periods in the past^[được mặc trong những trang phục của các thời kỳ khác nhau trong quá khứ.], which even carry on conversations together^[thậm chí còn trò chuyện với nhau nhau]. As well as that^[ngoài ra], in every room there <span class="htd">are</span> booklets^[trong mỗi phòng đều có những cuốn sách nhỏ] giving information about^[cung cấp thông tin về] what the room <span class="qkd">was used</span> for^[mục đích sử dụng của căn phòng] and the history of the objects and furniture it <span class="htd">contains</span>^[cũng như lịch sử của các đồ vật và đồ đạc trong phòng].

The castle <span class="htd">park’s</span> quite extensive^[Công viên lâu đài khá rộng]. At one time sheep <span class="qkd">were kept</span> there^[Ngày xưa cừu từng được nuôi ở đó ], and in the nineteenth century^[vào thế kỷ 19] the owners <span class="qkd">had</span> a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant^[những người chủ có một đã có một vườn thú nhỏ với những con vật như thỏ và thậm chỉ cả một con voi con]. Nowadays^[ngày này] the old zoo buildings <span class="htd">are used</span> for public displays of painting and sculpture^[những tòa nhà vườn thú cũ được sử dụng cho các cuộc trưng bày công cộng về hội họa và điêu khắc]. The park also <span class="htd">has</span> some beautiful trees^[Công viên cũng có nhiều cây đẹp], though the oldest of all^[mặc dù cây cổ nhất trong số đó], which dated back 800 years^[có niên đại 800 năm], <span class="htd">was sadly blown</span> down in 1987.

Now^[hiện nay], <span class="htd">you’re</span> free to wander around on your own^["on your own" là một cụm từ cố định mang nghĩa "một mình" hoặc "tự mình"] until 4.30^[bạn có thể tự do đi tham quan cho đến 4 giờ 30], but then at the end of our visit^[nhưng sau đó vào cuối chuyến thăm của chúng ta] <span class="tld">we’ll all meet</span> together at the bottom of the Great Staircase^[tất cả chúng ta sẽ gặp nhau ở cuối Cầu thang Lớn]. <span class="tld">We’ll then go</span> on to the long gallery^[Sau đó, chúng ta sẽ đi đến phòng trưng bày đã từ rất lâu rồi], where <span class="htd">there’s</span> a wonderful collection of photographs^[nơi có một bộ sưu tập ảnh tuyệt đẹp] showing the family who <span class="qkd">owned</span> the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory^[chụp gia đình từng sở hữu lâu đài 100 năm trước, khi họ uống trà và ăn bánh trong nhà kính.] – and <span class="tld">we’ll then take</span> you to the same place, where afternoon tea <span class="tld">will be served</span> to you^[và sau đó chúng tôi sẽ đưa bạn đến chính địa điểm đó, nơi trà chiều sẽ được phục vụ cho bạn].

——————————-

Now if you <span class="modal-verb">can take</span> a look at your plans^[Bây giờ, nếu bạn có thể xem qua kế hoạch của mình] <span class="tld">you’ll see</span> Branley Castle <span class="htd">has</span> four towers, <span class="htd">joined</span> together by a high wall, with the river on two sides^[bạn sẽ thấy Lâu đài Branley có bốn tòa tháp, được nối với nhau bằng một bức tường cao, với dòng sông ở hai bên].

<span class="htd">Don’t miss</span> seeing the Great Hall^[Đừng bỏ lỡ việc chiêm ngưỡng Đại Sảnh Lớn]. <span class="htd">That’s</span> near the river in the main tower^[Nó nằm gần sông trong tòa tháp chính], the biggest one^[tòa tháp lớn nhất], which <span class="qkd">was extended and redesigned</span> in the eighteenth century^[được mở rộng và thiết kế lại vào thế kỷ thứ mười tám].

If you <span class="htd">want</span> to get a good view of the whole castle^[Nếu bạn muốn có một tầm nhìn đẹp bao quát toàn bộ lâu đài], you <span class="modal-verb">can walk</span> around the walls^[bạn có thể đi bộ xung quanh những bức tường]. The starting <span class="htd">point’s</span> quite near the main entrance^[Điểm bắt đầu khá gần lối vào chính] – <span class="htd">walk</span> straight down the path until you <span class="htd">get</span> to the south gate, and <span class="htd">it’s</span> just there^[hãy đi thẳng xuống con đường cho đến khi bạn đến cổng phía nam, và nó ở ngay đó]. <span class="htd">Don’t go</span> on to the north gate^[Đừng đi tiếp đến cổng bắc] – <span class="htd">there’s</span> no way up from there^[từ đó thì không có lối nào đi lên].

<span class="tld">There’ll shortly be</span> a show^[Sắp tới sẽ có một buổi biểu diễn] in which <span class="modal-verb">you can see</span> archers displaying their skill^[mà trong đó bạn có thể xem những người bắn cung thể hiện kỹ năng của họ] with a bow and arrow^[với cung và tên]. The quickest way to get there^[Cách nhanh nhất để đến đó] <span class="htd">is</span> to take the first left after the main entrance^[là rẽ trái đầu tiên sau lối vào chính] and follow the path past the bridge^[và đi theo con đường băng qua cây cầu], then <span class="tld">you’ll see</span> it in front of you at the end^[rồi bạn sẽ thấy nó ngay trước mặt mình ở cuối đường.].

If you <span class="htd">like</span> animals^[Nếu bạn thích động vật] <span class="htd">there’s</span> also a display of hunting birds^[thì cũng có một buổi trưng bày các loài chim săn mồi] – falcons and eagles and so on^[như chim ưng, đại bàng và vân vân]. If you <span class="htd">go</span> from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate^[Nếu bạn đi từ cổng chính theo hướng cổng phía nam], but <span class="htd">turn</span> right before you <span class="htd">get</span> there^[nhưng rẽ phải trước khi đến đó] instead of going through it^[thay vì đi xuyên qua cổng], <span class="tld">you’ll see</span> it on your right past the first tower^[bạn sẽ thấy nó ở bên phải khi đi qua tòa tháp đầu tiên].

At 3 pm <span class="htd">there’s</span> a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage^[Vào lúc 3 giờ chiều, có một màn biểu diễn múa truyền thống ngắn trên sân khấu ngoài trời]. <span class="htd">That’s</span> right at the other side of the castle^[Nó nằm ngay phía bên kia lâu đài] from the entrance^[tính từ cổng vào], and over the bridge^[và qua cây cầu]. <span class="htd">It’s</span> about ten minutes’ walk or so^[Sẽ mất khoảng mười phút đi bộ hoặc lâu hơn].

And finally the shop^[Và cuối cùng là cửa hàng]. <span class="htd">It’s</span> actually inside one of the towers^[Thật ra nó nằm bên trong một trong các tòa tháp], but the way in <span class="htd">is</span> from the outside^[nhưng lối vào là từ bên ngoài]. Just <span class="htd">take</span> the first left after the main entrance^[Chỉ cần rẽ trái đầu tiên sau lối vào chính], <span class="htd">go</span> down the path and <span class="htd">take</span> the first right^[đi xuống con đường và rẽ phải ở chỗ rẽ đầu tiên]. <span class="htht">It’s got</span> some lovely gifts and souvenirs^[Trong đó có một vài món quà và đồ lưu niệm đẹp].

Right, so <span class="httd">we’re just arriving</span> …

### **SECTION 3**

TUTOR:            So, Rosie and Martin, let’s look at what you’ve got for your presentation on woolly mammoths.

ROSIE:             OK, we’ve got a short outline here.

TUTOR:            Thanks. So it’s about a research project in North America?

MARTIN:         Yes. But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.

ROSIE:             Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, (**Q21**) **it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations**?

MARTIN:         Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.

TUTOR:            Good. Then you’re describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.

ROSIE:             Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in really good condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.

TUTOR:            So why was that significant?

ROSIE:             Well (**Q22**) **the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that**. So this was really amazing.

MARTIN:         Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.

ROSIE:             Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland. So (**Q23**) **those mammoths on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island**.

MARTIN:         And in fact the species survived there for thousands of years after they’d become extinct on the mainland.

TUTOR:            So why do you think they died out on the mainland?

ROSIE:             No one’s sure.

MARTIN:         Anyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the _island_. They concluded that (**Q24**) **the extinction happened 5,600 years ago, which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction**. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.

————————-

TUTOR:            So why don’t you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?

MARTIN:         OK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.

ROSIE:             I’m not sure. I think (**Q25**) **we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here**, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important …

MARTIN:         You’re right.

ROSIE:             The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part, but we don’t have that much information, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe (**Q26**) **we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team and ask him to tell us a bit more**.

MARTIN:          Great idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.

ROSIE:             We could (**Q27**) **ask the audience to suggest some questions about it and then see how many of them we can answer**. I don’t think it would take too long.

TUTOR:            Yes that would add a bit of variety.

MARTIN:         Then the section on further research carried out on the island – analysing the mud in the lake. I wonder if we’ve actually got too much information here, should we cut some?

ROSIE:             I don’t think so, but it’s all a bit muddled at present.

MARTIN:         Yes, (**Q28**) **maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern**.

ROSIE:             I think so. The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practice it (**Q29**) **so we’re sure it won’t overrun**.

MARTIN:          I think it should be OK, but yes, let’s make sure.

TUTOR:            In the last section, relevance to the present day, you’ve got some good ideas but this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and (**Q30**) **give your own viewpoint**.

MARTIN:         OK, we’ll think about that. Now shall we …

### **SECTION 4**

In this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting, I’ll start by examining its early history – that’ll be the subject of today’s talk.

Ok, so we’ll start by going back thousands of years. Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, played an important role in many creation myths. Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods, as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows. For instance, there’s the Egyptian sun god Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as (**Q31**) **dances** in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.

But the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important, in fact their (**Q32**) **survival** depended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of (**Q33**) **clouds** and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 (**Q34**) **festivals**, each associated with a different weather phenomenon.

The ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms. He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and (**Q35**) **comets**. Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions, such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth. Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.

———————–

For nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red (**Q36**) **sky** at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate, as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.

For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observation, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for (**Q37**) **instruments**. Until then, the only ones available were weather vanes – to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.

In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first (**Q38**) **thermometer**. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure. In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686, and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.

This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the eighteenth century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that (**Q39**) **storms** generally travel from west to east.

In addition to new meteorological instruments, other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of the (**Q40**) **telegraph** made it possible for these records to be collated. This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.

It was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point next week.

## **TEST 3**

### **SECTION 1**

ANGELA:         Hello, Flanders conference hotel.

MAN:               Oh, hi. I <span class="htd">wanted to ask</span> about conference facilities at the hotel. <span class="htht">Have I come through</span> to the right person?

ANGELA:         You <span class="htd">have</span>. <span class="htd">I’m</span> the customer services manager. My <span class="htd">name’s</span> Angela. So how <span class="htd">can I help</span> you?

MAN:               Well, <span class="htd">I’m calling</span> from Barrett and Stansons, <span class="htd">we’re</span> a medical company based in Perth.

ANGELA:         Oh yes.

MAN:               And <span class="httd">we’re organising</span> a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney. <span class="tld">It’ll be held</span> over two days and <span class="httd">we’re expecting</span> about fifty or sixty people.

ANGELA:         When <span class="qktd">were you thinking</span> of having it?

MAN:               Some time early next year, like the end of January? It’d have to be a weekend^[It would have to be … → cách nói lịch sự để đặt điều kiện hoặc giới hạn về thời gian.].

ANGELA:         Let me see … our conference facilities <span class="htd">are already booked</span> for the weekend beginning January 28th. We could do the first weekend in February?

MAN:               How about January 21st?

ANGELA:         I’m afraid^[I’m afraid: Cụm từ cố định trong tiếng Anh lịch sự, nghĩa “Rất tiếc / e rằng…”.] <span class="htd">that’s booked</span> too.

MAN:               Well, let’s go for the February date then.

ANGELA:         So <span class="htd">that’s</span> the weekend beginning the 4th.

MAN:               OK. Now <span class="htd">can you tell</span> me a bit about what conference facilities <span class="htd">you have</span>?

ANGELA:         Sure. So for talks and presentations we <span class="htd">have</span> the Tesla room.

MAN:               Sorry?

ANGELA:         Tesla – <span class="htd">that’s spelled</span> T-E-S-L-A. it <span class="htd">holds</span> up to a hundred people, and <span class="htd">it’s</span> fully equipped with a projector and so on.

MAN:               How about a microphone?

ANGELA:         Yes, <span class="tld">that’ll be</span> all set up ready for you, and <span class="tld">there’ll be</span> one that members of the audience <span class="htd">can use</span> too, for questions, if necessary.

MAN:               Fine. And <span class="tld">we’ll also need</span> some sort of^[some sort of = “một loại / kiểu nào đó”.] open area where people<span class="htd"> can sit and have</span> a cup of coffee, and we’d like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well, so <span class="tld">that’ll need</span> to be quite a big space.

ANGELA:         <span class="htd">That’s fine</span>, <span class="htd">there’s</span> a central atrium with all those facilities, and you <span class="htd">can come</span> before the conference <span class="htd">starts</span> if you <span class="htd">want</span> to set everything up.

MAN:               Great. And I <span class="htd">presume</span> there’s wifi?

ANGELA:         Oh yes, <span class="htd">that’s</span> free and available throughout the hotel.

MAN:               OK.

ANGELA:         Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch? We <span class="htd">can do</span> a two-course meal with a number of different options^[a number of different options: với nhiều lựa chọn khác nhau].

MAN:               What sort of price <span class="httd">are we looking</span> at for that?

ANGELA:         Well, I <span class="htd">can send</span> you a copy of the standard menu. <span class="htd">That’s</span> $45 per person. Or you <span class="htd">can have</span> the special for $25 more.

MAN:               I <span class="htd">think</span> the standard should be OK, but yes, <span class="htd">send</span> me the menu.

———————–       

MAN:               Now <span class="httd">we’re also going</span> to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants … <span class="htd">I’m</span> not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what <span class="htd">do you change</span> for a room?

ANGELA:         Well, for conference attendees we <span class="htd">have</span> a 25% reduction, so we <span class="htd">can offer</span> you rooms at $135. Normally a standard <span class="htd">room’s</span> $180.

MAN:               And <span class="htd">does that include</span> breakfast?

ANGELA:         Sure. And of course, guests<span class="htd"> can also make use</span> of all the other facilities at the hotel. So <span class="htht">we’ve got</span> a spa where you <span class="htd">can get</span> massages and facials and so on, and <span class="htd">there’s </span>a pool up on the roof for the use of guests.

MAN:               Great. Now what about transport links? The <span class="htd">hotel’s</span> downtown, <span class="htd">isn’t</span> it?

ANGELA:          Yes, <span class="htd">it’s</span> about 12 kilometres from the airport, but <span class="htd">there’s</span> a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And <span class="htd">it’s</span> only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station.

MAN:               OK. Now, I <span class="htd">don’t know</span> Sydney very well, <span class="htd">can you just give</span> me an idea of the location of the hotel?

ANGELA:         Well, <span class="htd">it’s</span> downtown on Wilby Street, <span class="htd">that’s</span> quite a small street, and <span class="htd">it’s</span> not very far from the sea. And of course if the conference attendees <span class="htd">want to go</span> out on the Saturday evening <span class="htd">there’s</span> a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they <span class="htd">want to make</span> a night of it, they <span class="htd">can go</span> on to one of the clubs in the area – <span class="htd">there are</span> a great many to choose from.

MAN:               OK. So if we <span class="htd">go</span> ahead with this, <span class="htd">can you give</span> me some information about how much …

### **SECTION 2**

Good morning. My <span class="htd">name’s</span> Lucy Crittenden, and <span class="htd">I’m</span> the Director of Operations^[Director of Operations: giám đốc vận hành] for an organisation that <span class="htd">arranges</span> volunteering in this part of the country. <span class="httd">I’m hoping</span> I <span class="modal-verb">can persuade</span> one or two of you^[one or two of you: một vài người trong số các bạn] to become volunteers yourselves. Let me start by briefly explaining what we <span class="htd">mean</span> by volunteering.

Volunteers <span class="htd">are</span> teenagers and adults who <span class="htd">choose to spend</span> some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way^[in some way: bằng một cách nào đó]. Most volunteers <span class="htd">devote</span> two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more. The people they help <span class="modal-verb">may have</span> physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.

Volunteers<span class="modal-verb"> can do</span> all sorts of things^[all sorts of things = đủ loại việc khác nhau], depending on^[depending on = tùy thuộc vào] their own abilities and interests^[abilities and interests = khả năng và mối quan tâm]. If <span class="httd">they’re supporting</span> a family <span class="httd">that’s struggling</span>^[a family that’s struggling = một gia đình mà (hiện tại) đang gặp khó khăn], for example, they <span class="modal-verb">may be</span> able to give them tips on cooking, or <span class="htd">recommend</span> how to <span class="htd">plan</span> their budget or how to <span class="htd">shop</span> sensibly on their income. They <span class="modal-verb">might even do</span> some painting or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even <span class="htd">do</span> some babysitting so that parents <span class="modal-verb">can go out</span> for a while^[for a while = trong chốc lát, một lúc].

The benefit from volunteering <span class="htd">isn’t</span> only for the people <span class="httd">being helped</span>. Volunteers also <span class="htd">gain</span> from it: <span class="httd">they’re using</span> their skills to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health^[ill health = sức khỏe kém], and volunteering <span class="modal-verb">may be</span> a valuable element of their CV when <span class="httd">they’re applying</span> for jobs: employers usually <span class="htd">look</span> favourably on^[look favourably on = đánh giá tích cực / nhìn nhận tốt về.] someone <span class="htht">who’s given</span> up time to help others. Significantly, most volunteers <span class="htd">feel</span> that what <span class="httd">they’re doing</span> gives them a purpose in their lives. And in my opinion, <span class="htd">they’re</span> lucky in that respect, as many people <span class="htd">don’t have</span> that feeling.

——————–

Now <span class="modal-verb">I’d like</span> to tell you what some of our volunteers <span class="htht">have said</span> about what they <span class="htd">do</span>, <span class="htd">to give</span> you an idea of the range of ways^[the range of ways = nhiều cách thức khác nhau] in which they <span class="modal-verb">can help</span> people.

Habib <span class="htd">supports</span> an elderly lady <span class="httd">who’s beginning</span> to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, <span class="htd">go to</span> the local community centre, where a group of people <span class="htd">come</span> in and <span class="htd">sing</span>. The songs <span class="htd">take</span> the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they <span class="modal-verb">can forget</span> the difficulties that they <span class="htd">face</span> now.

Our volunteer Consuela <span class="htd">is</span> an amazing woman. She <span class="htd">has</span> difficulty walking herself, but she <span class="htd">doesn’t let</span> that <span class="htd">stop</span> her. She <span class="htd">helps</span> a couple of people with similar difficulties, who <span class="qkht">had almost stopped</span> walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela <span class="htd">encourages</span> them to walk more and more.

Minh <span class="htd">visits</span> a young man who <span class="htd">lives</span> alone and <span class="modal-verb">can’t leave</span> his home on his own, so he hardly ever <span class="qkd">saw</span> anyone. But together they <span class="htd">go out</span> to the cinema, or to <span class="htd">see</span> friends the young man <span class="qkht">hadn’t been</span> able to visit for a long time.

Tanya <span class="htd">visits</span> an elderly woman once a week. When the woman <span class="qkd">found out</span> that Tanya <span class="htd">is</span> a professional dressmaker, she <span class="qkd">got</span> interested. Tanya <span class="qkd">showed</span> her some soft toys <span class="qkht">she’d made</span>, and the woman <span class="qkd">decided</span> to try it herself. And now she really <span class="htd">enjoys</span> it, and <span class="htd">spends</span> hours making toys. <span class="htd">They’re</span> not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she <span class="htd">gains</span> a lot of pleasure from doing it.

Alexei <span class="htd">is</span> a volunteer with a family that <span class="htd">faces</span> a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, <span class="httd">he’s helping</span> them to realise that they <span class="htd">aren’t</span> helpless, and that they <span class="modal-verb">can do</span> something themselves to improve their situation. This <span class="htht">has been</span> great for their self-esteem.

And the last volunteer <span class="tld">I’ll mention</span>, though there <span class="htd">are</span> plenty more, <span class="htd">is</span> Juba. She <span class="htd">volunteers</span> with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who <span class="qkd">wasn’t</span> very good at talking to other people. <span class="htht">Juba’s worked</span> very patiently with her, and now the girl <span class="htd">is</span> far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people.

OK, I <span class="htd">hope</span> <span class="htht">that’s given</span> you an idea of what volunteering <span class="htd">is</span> all about. Now <span class="modal-verb">I’d like</span> …

### **SECTION 3**

LIZZIE:            So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?

JOE:                 Well I’ve been put in charge of the school marching band, and it’s quite a responsibility. I’d like to talk it over with you.

LIZZIE:             Go ahead. You’d better start by giving me a bit of background.

JOE:                 OK. Well the band has students in it from all years, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about (**Q21**) **50** of them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.

LIZZIE:              I can imagine.

JOE:                 They aren’t really good enough to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a (**Q22**) **regional** one later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to try and improve.

LIZZIE:             Yes, hopefully.

JOE:                 Well, now the town council’s organising a (**Q23**) **carnival** in the summer, and the band has been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t really up to it yet, and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.

LIZZIE:             Have you been doing anything with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.

JOE:                 I played a recording I came across, of a (**Q24**) **drummer** talking about how playing in a band had changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.

LIZZIE:             That’s good.

JOE:                 I’m planning to show them that old (**Q25**) **film** from the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What do you think?

LIZZIE:             Good idea. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.

JOE:                 That’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m hoping I can take some of the band to a (**Q26**) **parade** that’s going to take place next month. A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.

LIZZIE:             Mmm. They sound like good ideas to me.

JOE:                 Thanks.

—————————

JOE:                 Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I’m finding it quite difficult to cope with? I’m sure you’ll have some ideas about what I can do.

LIZZIE:             Go ahead.

JOE:                 There’s a flautist who says she loves playing in the band. We rehearse twice a week after school, but (**Q27**) **she’s hardly ever there**. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.

LIZZIE:             Oh dear! Any more students with difficulties?

JOE:                 Plenty! There’s a trumpeter who thinks she’s the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn’t. (**Q28**) **She’s always saying what she thinks other people should do**, which makes my job pretty difficult.

LIZZIE:             She sounds a bit of a nightmare!

JOE:                 You can say that again. One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm, and could be an excellent musician – except that (**Q29**) **he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really have enough breath for the trombone**. He’d be much better of playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.

LIZZIE:             I suppose you have to admire his determination.

JOE:                 Maybe. One of the percussionists isn’t too bad, but (**Q30**) **he never seems to interact with other people, and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends**. I don’t know if there are family reasons, or what. But it isn’t good in a band, where people really need to feel they’re part of a group.

LIZZIE:             Hmm.

JOE:                 There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I’m up against. Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?

### **SECTION 4**

As you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year, and here in the music department we’ve planned three concerts. These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and Australian composers. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.

The first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano – like so many children – and also the (**Q31**) **violin**. But when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in other countries. As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras, other performers and festivals in several countries.

Liza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of (**Q32**) **energy**, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called _The Compass_. Her music is very expressive, so although it is (**Q33**) **complex**, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.

In the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of _The Oresteia_. This is an (**Q34**) **opera** in seven parts, based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also (**Q35**) **disturbing**, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.

——————————-

Moving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by British composers – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: _The Tower of Remoteness_. According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek, overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees, listening to the birds and insects. _The Tower of Remoteness_ is scored for piano and (**Q36**) **clarinet**. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.

Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s well known in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a wide range of music, from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children. Edward’s music has been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the (**Q37**) **diversity** of cultures that Australia can be proud of.

The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study (**Q38**) **physics**, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer. Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for (**Q39**) **dance**, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.

In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the (**Q40**) **Olympics** held in 1996. This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide, and we’ll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.

## **TEST 4**

### **SECTION 1**

ANDREW:        Good morning, Clare House Hotel. Andrew speaking. <span class="htd">I’m</span> the Events Manager.

SAM:               Good morning, Andrew. My <span class="htd">name’s</span> Samantha. <span class="httd">I’m arranging</span> a party for my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, and <span class="httd">I’m ringing</span> to ask about hiring a room some time next September. Also my parents and several of the guests <span class="tld">will need</span> accommodation.          

ANDREW:        OK, <span class="htd">I’m</span> sure we <span class="htd">can help</span> you with that. <span class="tltd">Will you be having</span> a sit-down meal or a buffet?

SAM:               Probably a sit-down.

ANDREW:        And <span class="htd">do you know</span> how many people <span class="tld">there’ll be</span>?

SAM:               Around eighty, I <span class="htd">think</span>.

ANDREW:        Well we <span class="htd">have</span> two rooms that <span class="htd">can hold</span> that number. One <span class="htd">is</span> the Adelphi Room. That <span class="htd">can seat</span> eighty-five, or <span class="htd">hold</span> over a hundred if people <span class="httd">are standing</span> for a buffet.

SAM:               Right.

ANDREW:        If you <span class="htd">have</span> live music, <span class="htd">there’s</span> room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room. Our guests usually <span class="htd">appreciate</span> the fact that the music <span class="htd">can be</span> loud enough for dancing, but not too loud for conversation.

SAM:               Yes, I really <span class="htd">don’t like</span> it when you <span class="htd">can’t talk</span>.

ANDREW:        Exactly. Now the Adelphi Room <span class="htd">is</span> at the back of the hotel, and there <span class="htd">are</span> French windows leading out onto the terrace. This <span class="htd">has</span> a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year.

SAM:               Which direction <span class="htd">does it face</span>?

ANDREW:        Southwest, so that side of the hotel <span class="htd">gets</span> the sun in the afternoon and early evening.

SAM:               Very nice.

ANDREW:        From the terrace you <span class="htd">can see</span> the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel, or you <span class="htd">can stroll</span> through there to the river – <span class="htd">that’s </span>on the far side, so it <span class="htd">isn’t</span> visible from the hotel.

SAM:               OK.

ANDREW:        Then another option <span class="htd">is</span> the Carlton Room. This <span class="htd">is</span> a bit bigger – it <span class="htd">can hold</span> up to a hundred and ten people – and it <span class="htd">has</span> the advantage of a stage, which <span class="htd">is</span> useful if you <span class="htd">have</span> any entertainment, or indeed a small band <span class="htd">can fit</span> onto it.

SAM:               And <span class="htd">can you go</span> outside from the room?

ANDREW:        No, the Carlton Room <span class="htd">is</span> on the first floor, but on one side the windows <span class="htd">look</span> out onto the lake.

SAM:               Lovely. I <span class="htd">think</span> either of those rooms would be suitable.

ANDREW:        <span class="htd">Can I tell</span> you about some of the options we <span class="htd">offer</span> in addition?

SAM:               Please <span class="htd">do</span>.

ANDREW:        As well as a meal, you can <span class="htd">have</span> an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, <span class="tld">who’ll be</span> with you throughout the party.

SAM:               What exactly <span class="htd">is</span> the MC’s function? I <span class="htd">suppose</span> they<span class="htd"> make</span> a speech during the meal if we <span class="htd">need</span> one, <span class="htd">do</span> they?

ANDREW:        <span class="htd">That’s</span> right. All our MCs <span class="htd">are trained</span> as public speakers, so they <span class="htd">can easily get</span> people’s attention – many guests <span class="htd">are</span> glad to have someone who <span class="htd">can make</span> themselves heard above the chatter! And <span class="htd">they’re</span> also your support – if anything <span class="htd">goes</span> wrong, the MC <span class="tld">will deal </span>with it, so you <span class="htd">can relax</span>.

SAM:               Great! <span class="tld">I’ll need</span> to ask you about food, but something else <span class="htd">that’s</span> important <span class="htd">is</span> accommodation. You obviously <span class="htd">have</span> rooms in the hotel, but <span class="htd">do you also have</span> any other accommodation, like cabins, for example?

ANDREW:        Yes, there <span class="htd">are</span> five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each <span class="htd">sleep</span> two to four people and <span class="htd">have</span> their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.

SAM:               That <span class="htd">sounds</span> perfect for what <span class="tld">we’ll need</span>.

——————————

SAM:               Now you <span class="htd">have</span> various facilities, <span class="htd">don’t</span> you? <span class="htd">Are they all included</span> in the price of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.

ANDREW:        Normally<span class="htd"> you’d be</span> able to use it, but <span class="tld">it’ll be closed</span> throughout September for refurbishment, <span class="htd">I’m</span> afraid. The gym <span class="tld">will be</span> available, though, at no extra charge. <span class="htd">That’s</span> open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.

SAM:               Right.

ANDREW:        And the tennis courts, but there <span class="htd">is</span> a small additional payment for those. We <span class="htd">have</span> four courts, and <span class="htd">it’s </span>worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there <span class="htd">can be</span> quite a long waiting list for them!

SAM:               Right. Now <span class="htd">could we discuss</span> the food? This<span class="htd"> would be</span> dinner, around seven o’clock …

### **SECTION 2**

Hello everyone. <span class="htd">I’m</span> Jake Stevens and <span class="htd">I’m</span> your rep^[rep = viết tắt của representative (người đại diện)] here at the hotel. <span class="htd">I’m</span> sure <span class="tld">you’ll all have</span> a great time here. So let me <span class="htd">tell</span> you a bit about <span class="htd">what’s</span> on offer. <span class="tld">I’ll start</span> by telling you about some of the excursions^[some of the excursions = một vài chuyến tham quan] that <span class="htd">are</span> available for guests.

One thing you <span class="htd">have to do</span> while <span class="htd">you’re</span> here <span class="htd">is</span> go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well <span class="htd">guarantee</span> <span class="tld">you’ll see</span> dolphins – if you <span class="htd">don’t</span> you <span class="modal-verb">can repeat</span> the trip free of charge. We <span class="htd">organise</span> daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately <span class="htd">there aren’t</span> any places left for this afternoon’s trip, but <span class="htd">come and see</span> me to book for later in the week.

If <span class="htd">you’re</span> energetic, <span class="modal-verb">I’d recommend</span> our forest walk. <span class="htd">It’s</span> a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and <span class="tld">you’ll be provided</span> with a drink and sandwiches. <span class="htd">There’s</span> some fairly steep climbs up the hills, so you <span class="htd">need</span> to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and <span class="htd">bring</span> a waterproof in case it rains. <span class="htd">It’s</span> just 25 euros all inclusive, and <span class="htd">it’s</span> every Wednesday.

Then on Thursdays we <span class="htd">organise</span> a cycle trip, which<span class="tld"> will give</span> you all the fun of biking without the effort. <span class="tld">We’ll take</span> you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and <span class="htd">leave</span> you to bike back – <span class="htd">it’s</span> a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres so this <span class="htd">isn’t</span> really for inexperienced cyclists as <span class="tld">you’ll be</span> going pretty fast. And if <span class="htd">it’s</span> a clear day, <span class="tld">you’ll have</span> fantastic views.

On our local craft tour you <span class="modal-verb">can find out</span> about the traditional activities in the island. And the best thing about this trip <span class="htd">is</span> that <span class="htd">it’s</span> completely free. <span class="tld">You’ll be taken</span> to a factory where jewellery <span class="htd">is</span> made, and also a ceramics centre. If you <span class="htd">want</span>, you <span class="modal-verb">can buy</span> some of the products but<span class="htd"> that’s</span> entirely up to you. The trip <span class="htd">starts</span> after lunch on Thursday, and <span class="tld">you’ll return</span> by 6 pm.

If <span class="htd">you’re</span> interested in astronomy you <span class="modal-verb">may already know</span> that the island’s one of the best places in the world <span class="htd">to observe</span> the night sky. We <span class="modal-verb">can offer</span> trips to the observatory on Friday for those who <span class="htd">are</span> interested. They <span class="htd">cost</span> 90 euros per person and <span class="tld">you’ll be shown</span> the huge telescopes and <span class="htd">have</span> a talk from an expert,<span class="tld"> who’ll explain</span> all about how they <span class="htd">work</span>. Afterwards <span class="tld">we’ll head down</span> to Sunset Beach, where you <span class="modal-verb">can have</span> a dip in the ocean if you <span class="htd">want</span> before we <span class="htd">head off back</span> to the hotel.

Finally, <span class="htd">there’s</span> horse riding. This <span class="htd">is organised</span> by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and <span class="htd">it’s</span> a great experience if <span class="htd">you’re</span> a keen horseback rider, or even if <span class="htht">you’ve never been</span> on a horse before. They <span class="htd">take </span>you down to the beach, and you <span class="modal-verb">can canter</span> along the sand and through the waves. It <span class="htd">costs</span> 35 euros and <span class="htd">it’s</span> available every day.

So <span class="htd">there’s</span> plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?

Well, the number one <span class="htd">attraction’s called</span> ‘Musical Favourites’. Guests <span class="htd">enjoy</span> a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and <span class="htd">watch</span> a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas and finally Copacabana. At the end the cast members <span class="htd">come down</span> from the stage, still in their stunning costumes, and <span class="tld">you’ll have</span> a chance to chat with them. <span class="htd">It’s </span>hugely popular^[ugely popular = rất được ưa chuộng / phổ biến rộng rãi], so let me <span class="htd">know</span> now if <span class="htd">you’re </span>interested because <span class="htd">it’s</span> no good leaving it until the last minute^[until the last minute → cụm cố định nghĩa là “đến phút chót / phút cuối cùng”]. <span class="htd">It’s</span> on Friday night. Tickets <span class="htd">are</span> just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you <span class="modal-verb">can have</span> a table right by the stage.

If <span class="modal-verb">you’d like </span>to go back in time, <span class="htd">there’s</span> the Castle Feast on Saturday evening. <span class="htd">It’s held</span> in a twelfth-century castle, and you <span class="htd">eat</span> in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. <span class="htd">You’re given</span> a whole chicken each, which you <span class="htd">eat</span> in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery, and <span class="htd">you’re entertained</span> by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to <span class="htd">knock</span> one another off their horses. Then you <span class="modal-verb">can watch</span> the dancers in the ballroom and <span class="htd">join</span> in as well if you <span class="htd">want</span>. OK, so now if anyone …

### **SECTION 3**

STEPHANIE:     Hello, Trevor.

TREVOR:          Hello, Stephanie. You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.

STEPHANIE:     That’s right. I’m thinking of doing it next year, but I’d like to find out more about it first.

TREVOR:          OK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them. One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.

STEPHANIE:     You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.

TREVOR:          Right, and whether the teaching should be factual – giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that (**Q21**) **the writer isn’t necessarily conscious of the message they’re conveying**. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.

STEPHANIE:     I see what you mean.

TREVOR:          That module made me realise how important stories are – they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up. Actually, (**Q22**) **it inspired me to have a go at it myself**, just for my own interest. I know can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re very good, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.

STEPHANIE:     Mm. I’m very interested in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?

TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes central to the story.

STEPHANIE:     That’s good. I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so (**Q23**) **that’s the field I want to go into when I finish the course**. I bet that module will be really helpful.

TREVOR:          I’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.

STEPHANIE:     But children are so used to visual input – on TV, video games, and so on. There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even **try** to read a book, so I think (**Q24**) **comics can serve a really useful purpose**.

TREVOR:          You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? **Yes, I suppose you’re right**. I just think its sad when children don’t read books.

STEPHANIE:     What about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?

TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and played with dolls. I was amazed (**Q25**) **how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other**. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.

STEPHANIE:     That’s true. So it sounds as though you think it’s a good course.

TREVOR:          Definitely.

———————————-

TREVOR:          Have you been reading lots of children’s stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?

STEPHANIE:     Yeah. I’ve gone as far back as the late seventeenth century, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.

TREVOR:          So does that mean you’ve read Perrault’s fairy tales? _Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty_, and so on.

STEPHANIE:     Yes. They must be important, (**Q26**) **because no stories of that type had been written before, there were the first**. Then there’s _The Swiss Family Robinson_.

TREVOR:          I haven’t read that.

STEPHANIE:     The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be _The Swiss Robinsons_, because it’s about (**Q27**) **a Swiss family who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier**.

TREVOR:          Well I never knew that!

STEPHANIE:     Have you read Hoffmann’s _The Nutcracker and the Mouse King_?

TREVOR:          Wasn’t that (**Q28**) **the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet _The Nutcracker_**?

STEPHANIE:     That’s right. It has some quite bizarre elements.

TREVOR:          I hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s _The Happy Prince_. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of all time.

STEPHANIE:     Mine too! And it’s so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays, and most of them are very witty, but _The Happy Prince_ is really moving. (**Q29**) **I struggled with Tolkien’s _The Lord of the Rings – there long books, and I gave up after one_**.

TREVOR:          It’s extremely popular, though.

STEPHANIE:     Yeah, but whereas something like _The Happy Prince_ just carried me along with it, _The Lord of the Rings_ took more effort than I was prepared to give it.

TREVOR:          I didn’t find that – I love it.

STEPHANIE:     Another one I’ve read is _War Horse._

TREVOR:          Oh yes. It’s about the First Word War, isn’t it? (**Q30**) **Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story**.

STEPHANIE:     Exactly, but it’s been very successful. Have you read any …

### **SECTION 4**

In today’s class I’m going to talk about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.

Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an impressive monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a (**Q31**) **spring**, that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.

Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami, or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea. It’s been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.

For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove. Research on the buildings, (**Q32**) **tools** and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world. For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements, but the hard part is finding them.

Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts, but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed, some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous, which means they don’t need to be operated by a person.

Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create (**Q33**) **maps** of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so (**Q34**) **heavy** that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.

————————

But the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre – they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They’re also very sophisticated. They can communicate with each other and, for example, work out the most efficient way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.

Field tests show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the sixth century AD while ferrying prefabricated (**Q35**) **marble** elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.

Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves, but in water these will only travel a few centimetres. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share date using (**Q36**) **light**, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. But more creative solutions are also being developed, where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV, which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.

There’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries superior (**Q37**) **cameras**, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.

Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. One site where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying (**Q38**) **medical** goods, in wooden or tin receptacles. Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the (**Q39**) **eyes**.

Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held (**Q40**) **wine**. In many cases it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.

Another project that’s about to …

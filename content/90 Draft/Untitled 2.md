I would like to talk about Taylor Swift, a renowned pop singer, possesses millions of fans around the globe. When it comes to her appealing appearance, she looks like a supermodel with her slim figure and dazzling smiles. Taylor Swift always dresses to the nines either on stage or at red-carpet events. 

I dare say she has an aptitude for music, and her adoring voice draws people’s attention whenever she performs. You know, her massive hits always dominate the Billboard, one of the most prestigious music charts in the world. Every now and then, she joins her world tours to cosmopolitan metropolitan areas such as New York or London. 

Well, I think there are many vital reasons why Taylor Swift has the world at her feet. First and foremost, her music is absolutely melodious and catchy. Whenever her songs are being sung, I can’t help, yet sing along to them. Secondly, not only is she a well-known singer, but she is also a philanthropist raising fund for handicapped and homeless children who are less fortunate than other children.

- I dare say: tôi tin rằng
- has an aptitude for music: có năng khiếu về âm nhạc
- massive hits: những bài hit lớn
- Every now and then: thỉnh thoảng
- melodious and catchy: du dương và bắt tai

- She has a **slim figure** because she goes to the gym every day.
- **I dare say** he'll arrive late because the traffic is really terrible today.
- He always **dresses to the nines** whenever there's an important meeting.
- She **has an aptitude** for languages and can learn new ones very quickly.

I would like to talk about one of the most renowned bakeries/ coffee houses opened in Sai Gon. When it comes to its location, the shop is situated in the heart of the metropolis, near some must-come tourist attractions such as Notre-dame Cathedral and a well-known skyscraper, Bitexco Financial Tower. 

The first time that I set foot in the bakery/café was the opening day because they had advertised the shop on the local media a week before opening it. Therefore, locals, including me, knew the exact day. You know, they gave us free box of chocolates, biscuits and breads that were just out of this world. 

There are naturally a couple of vital reasons why the bakery/coffee shop has risen to fame. First and foremost, the shop’s cakes and desserts make our mouth water and its proximity to the city center allows customers to approach it conveniently. Secondly, the bakery’s/shop’s advertisement on the mass media has drawn people’s attenti on and increased its profile. I highly recommend that everyone visit the shop.

When it comes to cooking, my mom is the best in our family.
The hotel is located in the heart of the city, near all the attractions.
Just thinking about my mom's spicy noodles makes my mouth water.
Our office was chosen because of its proximity to the city center.
The locals are very friendly and always help tourists find their way around.


I am going to share with you about a historical event which was also considered as one of the most renowned stories of mythology, The Magical Crossbow. 2500 years ago, in Au Lac realm, King An Duong Vuong was given a magical crossbow which would be used to protect the fledgling kingdom.
Thanks to the crossbow, the country defeated northern invaders. Trieu Da, a northern despot, sought to reconcile and asked his son, Trong Thuy, for getting married with My Chau, a daughter of King An Duong Vuong.

I would like to talk about a long-lasting volume which has belonged to me a couple of decades now. The book originally derived from one of the most renowned stories of mythology called The Magical Crossbow.

When it comes to its absorbing content, its plot revolves around the swap of the magical crossbow, which led to the loss of the realm called Au Lac of King An Duong Vuong. Besides, the love tragedy between Trong Thuy and My Chau really conveys a spectrum of emotions. Speaking of frequency, if I have time
on my hands, I will read it from cover to cover in no time.
When I was just a tiny tot, my parents usually read it as a bedtime story. As I
get older, when I feel blue, it helped me cope with stress and ease my mind.
Honestly speaking, I’m not fed up with it, yet I am gradually engrossed in
reading this ancient book again and again. Moreover, this priceless volume
has been an heirloom of my family because it has been passed down through
many generations.

I want to talk about an old TV in my house. It’s an old antenna TV that my family bought about fifteen years ago. It’s big and heavy, and it has a long metal antenna on top to receive the signal.

At that time, this kind of TV was very popular. The picture was not very clear, and sometimes the signal was bad, so we had to move the antenna around to get a better image. It doesn’t have a flat screen like modern TVs.

My parents used to watch news and movies on this TV every evening. When I was a child, I often watched cartoons on it after school. It brings back many happy memories from my childhood.

We don’t use it anymore, but it still works. Although it’s old and not modern, I think it’s special because it was part of my family life for many years.

Tôi muốn nói về một chiếc tivi cũ trong nhà tôi. Đó là một chiếc tivi dùng ăng-ten mà gia đình tôi mua khoảng mười lăm năm trước. Nó to, nặng, và có một chiếc ăng-ten kim loại dài trên đầu để bắt sóng.

Hồi đó, loại tivi này rất phổ biến. Hình ảnh không được rõ lắm, và đôi khi tín hiệu yếu, nên chúng tôi phải xoay ăng-ten để có hình ảnh tốt hơn. Nó không có màn hình phẳng như tivi hiện đại.

Bố mẹ tôi thường xem tin tức và phim trên chiếc tivi này mỗi tối. Khi tôi còn nhỏ, tôi thường xem phim hoạt hình trên đó sau giờ học. Nó gợi lại nhiều kỷ niệm vui thời thơ ấu của tôi.

Chúng tôi không dùng nó nữa, nhưng nó vẫn hoạt động. Mặc dù nó cũ và không hiện đại, tôi nghĩ nó đặc biệt vì nó đã là một phần trong cuộc sống gia đình tôi suốt nhiều năm.

I want to talk about a time when I got very good service in a small noodle shop near my house. It’s a local and simple place, not fancy at all, but the food and the service were amazing.

I went there with my friend last month for breakfast. We ordered two bowls of beef pho and some iced tea. The owner, an old lady, was very friendly and kind. She smiled at us and brought the food very quickly.

The pho was delicious — hot, tasty, and full of fresh herbs. What I liked most was that the owner was very thoughtful. When I asked for more chili sauce, she gave it right away and even added some lime and onions without me asking.

I think it was good service because even though the shop was busy, the owner still cared about every customer. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable. I really enjoyed that meal and I often go back there every day.

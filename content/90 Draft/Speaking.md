One traditional food in my country is pho, which is a kind of noodle soup. It is very popular in Vietnam, and almost everyone likes it. Pho is made from rice noodles, beef or chicken, and a hot soup cooked with many spices like cinnamon, ginger and onion. People usually eat pho for breakfast, but some also eat it for lunch or dinner. It is sold everywhere, from small street stalls to big restaurants. 

I think pho is important in Vietnamese culture because it shows our simple lifestyle and love for fresh food. When foreigners visit Vietnam, they always try pho first because it represents our country. I often eat pho with my family on weekends, and it makes me feel warm and happy. I believe pho is not only delicious but also a part of our national identity.

### Topic: Describe a natural disaster you have seen or heard about

One natural disaster that I remember clearly is the severe flood in Central Vietnam in 2020. Heavy rain lasted for almost a week, causing rivers to overflow and destroying many villages. Thousands of houses were submerged, and people lost their belongings, crops, and even livestock. Many roads were blocked, which made it hard for rescue teams to reach the affected areas.

I watched the news every day, and the images were heartbreaking. I felt sorry for the people who suffered, especially the children and the elderly. Luckily, many volunteers and soldiers came to provide food, water, and clothes. After the flood, people worked together to rebuild their homes. 

This disaster reminded me of how important it is to protect nature and to have good plans for disaster prevention. It also showed the strong spirit and kindness of the Vietnamese people.

I want to talk about Ho Chi Minh City. It is the biggest city in Vietnam and it is in the south of the country. The city is very crowded and noisy because there are many people and a lot of motorbikes on the streets. When I went there, I visited Ben Thanh Market, where I could buy clothes and souvenirs. I also tried some delicious food, like noodles and sandwiches. The tall buildings in the center looked very modern and exciting. 

I like this city because it is busy and there are many things to do. Young people can go shopping, watch movies, or meet friends in coffee shops. However, I think sometimes life there is difficult. The traffic is always terrible, and the air is not clean. Even though I enjoyed my trip, I feel living there every day would be a little stressful. 

### Du lịch

Last summer, I visited Ha Long Bay with my friends and we spent three days near the sea. While we were taking a boat tour around the bay, we saw many tourists taking photos and enjoying the view. Ha Long Bay is a very wonderful and peaceful place to visit, and local people are always friendly and kind to visitors. I have visited several places in Vietnam, but Ha Long Bay has impressed me the most so far. I will definitely come back next year because I want to explore more islands and try more local seafood.
